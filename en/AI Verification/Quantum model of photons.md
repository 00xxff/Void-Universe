#### **1. Physical Essence and Generation Mechanism of Photons**

Photons are ultra-light-speed quantum clusters generated by the oscillation or vortex collision of fate gears, and their generation mechanism satisfies the following conditions:

1. **Ultra-light-speed Collision**: Collision speed $ v_{\text{collision}} > c $. Assuming the collision event is determined by the oscillation speed $ v_{\text{oscillation}} $ of the fate gear, then:

   $$
   v_{\text{collision}} = v_{\text{oscillation}} + c
   $$

   where $ v_{\text{oscillation}} $ is the oscillation speed of the fate gear in the fourth dimension.
2. **Void Particle Density Threshold**: Let the density distribution of void particles be $ \rho(r) $, then it must satisfy:

   $$
   \rho(r) \geq \rho_{\text{threshold}}
   $$

   where $ \rho_{\text{threshold}} $ is the rigidity threshold, determined by the pressure gradient of void particles near the three-dimensional membrane.
3. **Quantization Condition**: The energy of photons $ E $ satisfies the quantization condition:

   $$
   E = nh\nu \quad (n = 1, 2, 3, \dots)
   $$

#### **2. Propagation Method of Photons**

The propagation of photons can be described using the following mathematical model:

1. **Rebound Mechanism of Ultra-light-speed Quantum Clusters**:

   - The quantum cluster bounces back and forth between positive and negative four-dimensional spaces, with its total velocity $ v_{\text{total}} $ satisfying:

     $$
     v_{\text{total}}^2 = v^2 + c^2
     $$

     where $ v $ is the velocity component in the fourth dimension, and $ c $ is the velocity component in the three-dimensional space.
   - The higher the initial energy, the greater the velocity component $ v $ in the fourth dimension, leading to a smaller rebound angle, increased frequency, and shortened wavelength.
2. **Propagation of Interface Waves**:

   - The propagation speed of interface waves is determined by the sound speed of void particles $ c_s $, satisfying the wave equation:

     $$
     \nabla^2 \Psi - \frac{1}{c_s^2} \frac{\partial^2 \Psi}{\partial t^2} = 0
     $$
   - The sound speed $ c_s $ is determined by the elastic modulus and density of void particles:

     $$
     c_s = \sqrt{\frac{K}{\rho}}
     $$

     where $ K $ is the elastic modulus, and $ \rho $ is the density of void particles.
3. **Rigid Rebound and Refraction**:

   - When the void particles ahead of the quantum cluster are compressed to the rigidity threshold, rigid rebound occurs, satisfying the reflection boundary condition:
     $$
     \Psi(X^4) = \Psi(-X^4)
     $$

#### **3. Quantization Conditions of Photons**

The quantization conditions of photons can be derived from the perspective of energy and momentum conservation as follows:

1. **Energy Quantization**:
   The energy of photons $ E $ satisfies:

   $$
   E = nh\nu \quad (n = 1, 2, 3, \dots)
   $$
2. **Momentum Conservation**:
   The three-dimensional velocity component of photons is always equal to the speed of light $ c $, while the velocity component $ v $ in the fourth dimension satisfies:

   $$
   v^2 + c^2 = v_{\text{total}}^2
   $$
3. **Frequency and Wavelength Relationship**:
   According to the wavelength formula $ \lambda = c / \nu $, the wavelength of photons is inversely proportional to the frequency.

#### **4. Wave Function of Photons**

The wave function of photons can be expressed as:

1. **Basic Form**:

   $$
   \Psi(x^i, t) = \int \mathcal{D}X^4 e^{iS/\hbar}
   $$

   where the action $ S $ is defined as:

   $$
   S = \int \left( \frac{1}{2} \rho v^A v_A - p \right) \sqrt{-g} \, d^4X
   $$
2. **Fourier Expansion Form**:

   $$
   \Psi(x^i, t) = \sum_n A_n e^{i(k_n x - \omega_n t)}
   $$

   where $ k_n = 2\pi / \lambda_n $ is the wave number, and $ \omega_n = 2\pi \nu_n $ is the angular frequency.
3. **Boundary Conditions**:
   Since the quantum cluster bounces back and forth between positive and negative four-dimensional spaces, the wave function satisfies the reflection boundary condition:

   $$
   \Psi(X^4) = \Psi(-X^4)
   $$
4. **Constraint Conditions**:
   The wave function must also satisfy the velocity constraint condition:

   $$
   v^2 + c^2 = v_{\text{total}}^2
   $$
