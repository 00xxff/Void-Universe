### Cosmic Origin and Dimensional Reduction

We hypothesize that the void universe is a high-dimensional structure (more than four dimensions), filled with countless high-dimensional particles. At a certain moment, a portion of these high-dimensional particles in a particular region underwent dimensional collapse. This could have been due to the loss of energy support in one dimension or natural cooling leading to the collapse of the physical system in that dimension. The dimensional collapse triggered energy fluctuations in these high-dimensional particles across other dimensions, which in turn initiated further dimensional collapses. As the dimensional collapses occurred, part of the excess energy transformed into new lower-dimensional particles, and these newly generated lower-dimensional particles continued to participate in the dimensional collapse of the entire system. We refer to this process as the dimensional reduction of the universe.

During the dimensional reduction of the universe, there was an exponential increase in the number of lower-dimensional particles, releasing enormous amounts of energy, ultimately resulting in an effect similar to the Big Bang. Subsequently, the universe began to expand, energy was released, the void gradually cooled down, and the high-dimensional particles entered a stable state of continuous dimensional reduction. Meanwhile, an infinite number of lower-dimensional particles formed a stable three-dimensional universe within a four-dimensional crevice.

To describe this process, we define the fourth dimension of the three-dimensional space in which our universe resides as the "four-dimensional zero point." Within our four-dimensional reference frame, we can divide the four-dimensional space into positive and negative poles (i.e., positive and negative four-dimensional spaces), similar to defining the top and bottom sides of a piece of paper through it.

The reason this three-dimensional space can maintain stability is that it lies within the compressive force between two four-dimensional poles. The presence of this opposing force allows the lower-dimensional particles to cool down sufficiently to form ordered structures, thereby creating the material universe that we perceive.

(This phenomenon can be analogized to a sheet of paper: Suppose there is atmospheric pressure above the paper and equal atmospheric pressure below it. Due to the presence of these opposing pressures, the gas fluctuations above and below the paper are restricted to zero, forming a relatively stable two-dimensional plane universe. This is analogous to the state of our three-dimensional universe within a four-dimensional crevice.)

This is a reasonably plausible conjecture for the cosmic origin described by the void model. Specific issues such as the process of cosmic dimensional reduction, the actual state of the void universe, and the source of the high-dimensional particles that initiated the dimensional reduction require further exploration and research.
