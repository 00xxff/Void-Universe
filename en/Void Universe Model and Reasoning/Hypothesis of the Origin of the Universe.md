### Hypothesis of the Origin of the Universe: What is the Universe? How was it formed?

#### Introduction

We often ponder the essence and origin of the universe. To better understand this complex question, we can start with a simple analogy.

#### Analogy

Imagine you have a sheet of paper in your hand. When you lay it flat before you, the top and bottom of the paper represent two separate spaces. If we assume this paper to be infinitely large, it becomes a two-dimensional plane that divides our three-dimensional space into an upper and lower part. On this two-dimensional plane, we can distinguish between these two spaces using the positive and negative values along the z-axis.

Following this logic, let's assume the three-dimensional space we live in is akin to this sheet of paper; it is actually part of a four-dimensional space, dividing the four-dimensional space into positive and negative sides. In a four-dimensional coordinate system, we can differentiate these parts by the positive and negative values on the w-axis. Our universe is such a special structure existing within four-dimensional space.

#### Formation of the Universe

**1. Initial State**

Suppose before the formation of the universe, the entire four-dimensional space was filled with particles in violent motion, like a boiling pot. These particles moved at high speeds within the four-dimensional space, causing the entire system to be in a highly chaotic state.

**2. Formation of Three-Dimensional Membrane**

In three-dimensional space, consider a pot of hot soup. As it cools down, what is the first stable structure that forms? It would be some curled surfaces where pressure on both sides is balanced, which we can call "membranes".

Similarly, as the "hot soup" in four-dimensional space begins to cool, it also forms three-dimensional spaces with balanced pressure on both sides, known as "three-dimensional membranes". Our universe is one such "three-dimensional membrane".

Alternatively, imagine two volumes of four-dimensional "hot soup" expanding and colliding with each other, forming a "three-dimensional membrane" at their boundary with balanced pressure on both sides.

**3. Entropy Reduction Process**

However, given that our universe has existed for billions of years, the mere cooling or collision of four-dimensional "hot soup" cannot fully explain the formation of various fundamental physical laws and long-term stability in the universe. Therefore, certain special events must have occurred in between.

**4. Core Particle â€” Virtual Particle**

In an accidental discovery, I hypothesized a core particle and its characteristics. This particle is a four-dimensional particle with high-dimensional oscillations, which I refer to as a "virtual particle". The reason for calling it a four-dimensional particle is that we are only concerned with its portion in four-dimensional space, while its other dimensions are temporarily considered external energy sources leading to entropy reduction.

The shape of a virtual particle in four-dimensional space is a rapidly cycling oscillating hypersphere, simplified as a "four-dimensional gear"; its three-dimensional form is a rapidly oscillating sphere, described as a "three-dimensional gear" (later referred to as "Fate Gear"); its three-dimensional form is also known to us as a neutrino.

**5. Void Particles**

Assume this "pot of hot soup" is composed of more fundamental spatial particles. These particles have spatial properties, meaning they are mutually exclusive, rigid yet elastic, capable of conducting kinetic energy and being compressed. I call them "void particles". Void particles are created by virtual particles, and virtual particles in four-dimensional space continuously generate vast numbers of void particles. Void particles serve as the medium for the propagation of light and electromagnetic waves, so they could also be the yet-to-be-proven "ether" in the scientific community.

**6. Fate Gears**

When the "four-dimensional hot soup" cools down in a certain region, it forms a relatively stable three-dimensional space within the four-dimensional space, which we can view as a three-dimensional layer (three-dimensional membrane) inside the four-dimensional space. At this point, some virtual particles collide with this three-dimensional membrane. Due to the pressure from the opposite side of the three-dimensional membrane in four-dimensional space, the four-dimensional shape of the virtual particles is squeezed and deformed, becoming flatter on the side inside the three-dimensional membrane. This process is similar to pressing a balloon against the ground, where the part touching the ground turns into a larger circle. (The elasticity and compressibility of void particles can be viewed similarly)

The "four-dimensional gear" shape of the virtual particle inside the three-dimensional membrane forms a structure akin to a "four-dimensional gear", which we call a "three-dimensional gear" and later refer to as "Fate Gear".

**7. Void Circulation**

As the "three-dimensional gear" rapidly rotates, it brings in some void particles from four-dimensional space, creating jets that appear out of nowhere in three-dimensional space. Simultaneously, the rotating three-dimensional gear stirs the void particles inside the three-dimensional membrane, carrying some of them away from three-dimensional space and up into four-dimensional space at high speed. They then gradually fall back into the three-dimensional membrane due to four-dimensional pressure, thus forming a single-sided "void particle" circulation in either the positive or negative four-dimensional space, called "void circulation".

**8. Stability of the Three-Dimensional Layer**

The gathering of virtual particles in positive and negative four-dimensional spaces creates relatively balanced and stable void circulations, allowing this three-dimensional membrane to exist stably over the long term. This equilibrium not only maintains the structure of the three-dimensional membrane but also provides a stable environment for internal physical processes.

**9. Formation of Fundamental Particles**

Over time, more and more virtual particles gather on the three-dimensional membrane, causing it to expand and become more stable. Virtual particles interact through void circulation, combining to form various complex three-dimensional composite structures, which we call fundamental particles. These fundamental particles further interact to form larger composite structures, including atoms, molecules, crystals, and even organisms.

**10. Explanation of Physical Phenomena**

In modern physics:

- The four-dimensional circulation of these fundamental particles spanning positive and negative four-dimensional spaces is called an "electric field".
- The vertical precession particle vortex formed by the flipping vortices of the four-dimensional circulation of these fundamental particles during their three-dimensional motion is called a "magnetic field".
- The local spatial gradient pressure formed by the interaction between electric fields and magnetic fields in positive and negative four-dimensional spaces is called "electromagnetic force".
- The spatial gradient pressure produced by the interaction of void particle vortices among these fundamental particles in three-dimensional space is called "strong force".

**11. Formation of Gravity**

As mass accumulates, the number of virtual particles increases, leading to a greater influx of void particles and higher density. The structure of fate gears at the center of mass pulls a large number of void particles from three-dimensional space into four-dimensional space, creating a significant void negative pressure area in three-dimensional space. Driven by the background pressure of void particles and the intrusion pressure from four-dimensional space, void particles constantly flow toward the center of mass, eventually forming a void particle circulation spanning three-dimensional and four-dimensional spaces, termed "gravitational circulation". The intrusion pressure from four-dimensional space refers to countless void particles squeezing into the three-dimensional membrane from positive and negative four-dimensional spaces, bringing about a new omnidirectional dynamic expansion pressure in three-dimensional space.

This gravitational circulation forms a spherical void particle flow region pointing towards the center in three-dimensional space (i.e., the gravitational zone), together with its surrounding pressure diffusion area, which we call the "void sphere" of matter.

When two void spheres of matter are placed together, if their gravitational zones overlap, they will form a force directed towards the center of mass due to the interaction of fluid dynamic pressure gradients and four-dimensional intrusion pressure gradients in the gravitational zones, which we call "gravitation".

**12. Characteristics of the Universe**

- **Stability of Galaxies**: The characteristics of void spheres allow galaxies and galaxy clusters to maintain relatively stable rotational shapes without the need to introduce dark matter.
- **Cosmic Web Structure**: In regions without interactions between void spheres, void spheres exhibit repulsion. Meanwhile, the void space without matter is expanding due to four-dimensional intrusion, pushing galaxy clusters to the side on a cosmic scale, thereby forming numerous voids and creating the cosmic web structure.

### Conclusion

This is the universe we observe. By introducing the concepts of four-dimensional virtual particles and void particles, we can better understand the origin and evolution of the universe, explain various fundamental physical phenomena, and uncover deeper rules governing the structure of the universe.
