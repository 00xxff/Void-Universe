### **Michelson-Morley Experiment**

#### **1. Background and Traditional Explanation**

The Michelson-Morley experiment aimed to detect the existence of "ether wind," i.e., the motion of the medium through which light waves propagate relative to Earth. However, the experimental results showed that, regardless of Earth's state of motion, the speed of light remained constant in all directions. This result negated the classical ether hypothesis and laid the foundation for the development of special relativity.

However, in this model, "ether" is redefined as **void particles**, which serve as the medium for the propagation of light and electromagnetic waves. Void particles have dynamic flow characteristics, and their behavior is influenced by gravitational fields. Therefore, we need to analyze the properties of void particle flows within Earth's gravitational field to re-evaluate the results of the Michelson-Morley experiment.

#### **2. Characteristics of Void Particle Flow in Earth's Gravitational Field**

Based on our model's derivation of the essence of gravity:

- Within Earth's gravitational field, void particles flow from outer space toward the center of Earth, forming a spherical void particle flow (the three-dimensional part of the gravitational circulation).
- The velocity of the void particle flow at any point in the gravitational field equals the gravitational acceleration at that point, directed toward the center.
  - For example, on Earth's surface, the speed of the void particle flow is approximately \( g = 9.8 \, \text{m/s} \), directed vertically downward.
- This void particle flow is driven by the four-dimensional-to-three-dimensional invasion of the gravitational circulation and is uniformly distributed throughout the gravitational field.

Thus, the main characteristics of the void particle flow near Earth's surface are:

1. **Directionality**: The direction of the void particle flow always points toward the center of Earth, rather than changing with Earth's orbit or rotation.
2. **Velocity Value**: The speed of the void particle flow is low (about \( 9.8 \, \text{m/s} \)), much smaller than the speed of light (\( c \approx 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \)).
3. **Relative Stagnation**: Since the void particle flow rotates synchronously with Earth's gravitational field, the void particle flow near Earth's surface remains relatively stationary in other directions compared to Earth.

#### **3. Re-analysis of the Michelson-Morley Experiment**

Based on these characteristics, we can re-analyze the results of the Michelson-Morley experiment.

##### **(1) Experimental Design and Expectations**

The core assumption of the Michelson-Morley experiment was: if "ether wind" exists, then the speed of light would vary in different directions due to Earth's motion relative to the "ether." The experiment used an interferometer to measure the phase difference between two beams of light, attempting to detect this speed difference.

In the traditional ether hypothesis, "ether" was considered a rigid, static medium, and Earth's movement within it would produce "ether wind." However, in this model:

- The direction of the void particle flow always points toward the center of Earth, not changing with Earth's orbit or rotation.
- The speed of the vertical void particle flow is extremely low (about \( 9.8 \, \text{m/s} \)), much smaller than the speed of light, so its effect on the speed of light can be ignored.
- The void particle flow in other directions near Earth's surface remains relatively stationary compared to Earth, meaning there is no significant "ether wind" at Earth's surface.

##### **(2) Explanation of the Experimental Results**

According to our model, the reasons why the Michelson-Morley experiment failed to detect "ether wind" are as follows:

1. **Low-Speed Characteristics of Void Particles**:

   - On Earth's surface, the speed of the void particle flow is only \( 9.8 \, \text{m/s} \), negligible compared to the speed of light, so its effect on the phase of light can be ignored, far below the experimental precision of the Michelson-Morley experiment.
   - The speed of light is mainly determined by the density of void particles, and the density of void particles is relatively uniform on Earth's surface, causing the speed of light to remain constant in all directions.
2. **Relative Stagnation of Void Particle Flow**:

   - The void particle flow near Earth's surface rotates synchronously with Earth, so in Earth's reference frame, the void particle flow appears relatively stationary.
   - This means there is no significant "ether wind" on Earth's surface, explaining why no interference fringe changes were observed in the Michelson-Morley experiment.
3. **Screening Effect of the Gravitational Field**:

   - The void particle flow within Earth's gravitational field forms a stable spherical structure, shielding disturbances from external void particle flows.
   - Therefore, the void particle flow on Earth's surface is unaffected by Earth's orbit or the motion of the solar system, further ensuring the isotropy of the speed of light.

##### **(3) Limitations of the Experiment**

The design of the Michelson-Morley experiment was based on the following assumptions:

- "Ether" is a rigid, static medium.
- Earth's motion relative to "ether" produces a significant "ether wind."

However, in this model:

- Void particles are dynamic, non-rigid media (with variations in density).
- The vertical void particle flow near Earth's surface has an extremely low speed, and the flow in other directions remains relatively stationary with respect to Earth's rotation.

Therefore, the Michelson-Morley experiment did not actually negate the assumption that light requires a medium for propagation; it only negated the assumption of a static "ether."

#### **4. Conclusion**

In this model, the reasons why the Michelson-Morley experiment failed to detect "ether wind" can be summarized as follows:

1. The speed of the vertical void particle flow within Earth's gravitational field is extremely low (about \( 9.8 \, \text{m/s} \)), far below the experimental precision of the Michelson-Morley experiment.
2. The void particles near Earth's surface in other directions remain relatively stationary with respect to Earth, resulting in no significant "ether wind" in Earth's reference frame.
3. Earth's gravitational field screens out disturbances from external void particle flows, ensuring the isotropy of the speed of light.

Note:
Most current optical experiments conducted by humans are confined to closed containers, making it impossible to truly measure the effects of relatively moving void particle flows on the speed of light.
(Planetary or galactic gravitational fields can also be considered as generalized closed containers.)
Within Earth's gravitational field, the vertical void particle flow is equivalent to the gravitational effects described by general relativity, and the redshift and time delay derived using void particle flow are completely consistent with the results of general relativity (see: [Gravitational Redshift and Ether Wind](../AI%20Verification/Gravitational%20Redshift%20and%20Ether%20Wind.md)).

If we want to verify the existence of the void particle gravitational circulation (void sphere), we need to design new optical experiments, such as:
Earth-Synchronous Orbit Satellite-Moon Three-Point Straight-Line Laser Ranging Experiment
When the three points align (perpendicular to the Earth observation point), simultaneous laser ranging measurements are made from Earth and the synchronous orbit satellite to the Moon, as well as from Earth to the synchronous orbit satellite. Since the void sphere between Earth and the Moon is in relative motion,

we find:
The total light path when measuring directly from Earth to the Moon > the total light path when measuring from the synchronous orbit satellite to the Moon + the total light path when measuring from Earth to the synchronous orbit satellite.

If there were no relatively moving void particle flow, then it should be:
The total light path when measuring directly from Earth to the Moon = the total light path when measuring from the synchronous orbit satellite to the Moon + the total light path when measuring from Earth to the synchronous orbit satellite.
