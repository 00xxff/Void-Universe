### Overview of the Void Model

#### 1. **Core Definitions**

- **Four-Dimensional Universe**: Refers to four-dimensional space, filled with void particles and a large number of virtual particles.
- **Three-Dimensional Membrane**: Refers to a three-dimensional layer in the four-dimensional universe where the bidirectional four-dimensional pressure of void particles is balanced; this is the three-dimensional universe we perceive.
- **Virtual Particle**: One of the fundamental particles of the universe, its four-dimensional form is a hypersphere with light-speed fluctuations on its surface, and its three-dimensional form is a sphere with light-speed fluctuations on its surface. We call it "neutrino".
- **Void Particle**: One of the fundamental particles of the universe, an infinitely small spatial particle with rigidity and elasticity, serving as the medium for all forces and the propagation medium for light (similar to the traditional concept of "ether").

#### 2. **Composition of Fundamental Particles**

- **Fate Gear**: Refers to the part of a virtual particle in three-dimensional space. Because its three-dimensional form's cross-section resembles a gear rotating across dimensions, it is also the driving force behind universal laws (the source of four-dimensional pressure), hence called "fate gear".
- **Neutrino**: A single fate gear corresponds to the neutrino in the Standard Model. Since it is always in a four-dimensional oscillation state, neutrinos have strong penetration in three-dimensional space because their main body exists only on one side of the positive or negative four-dimensional space, carrying a one-sided four-dimensional void particle circulation and a one-sided penetrating flow, thus exhibiting chirality and being influenced by electromagnetic fields. To accurately describe the rotation direction and shape of neutrinos, we define the two poles of a neutrino based on its conceptual cross-sectional diagram as $b$ pole and $q$ pole, where $q$ pole represents the particle flow penetrating from positive/negative four-dimensional → three-dimensional → four-dimensional space, and $b$ pole represents the particle flow from three-dimensional to four-dimensional space. The rotation (surface fluctuation) direction of a neutrino in three-dimensional space is from $q$ pole to $b$ pole.
- **Electron**: Composed of 3 fate gears (3 positive neutrinos $qqq$) (electric field penetrating flow 3 negative), its primary particle flow morphology in three-dimensional space is a jet emanating outward from the core, so the behavior of electrons resembles that of a large rocket without tail fins. Additionally, since electrons are entirely composed of neutrinos from the same side of four-dimensional space, they are similarly in a four-dimensional oscillation state, making them appear intermittently in three-dimensional space. After increasing their four-dimensional oscillation energy level, they exhibit tunneling phenomena in three-dimensional space.
- **Proton**: Externally appears to be composed of 2 up quarks and 1 down quark, but it is speculated that there should also be a large amount of equal $bb\bar{q}$ and $\bar{b}\bar{b}q$ neutrinos forming quark-antiquark pairs.
- **Up Quark**: Speculated to be composed of 6 neutrinos (2 positive 1 negative $bb\bar{q}$ + 2 positive 1 negative $bb\bar{q}$) (electric field penetrating flow 2 positive).
- **Down Quark**: Speculated to be composed of 9 neutrinos (2 positive 1 negative $bb\bar{q}$ + 1 positive 2 negative $\bar{b}\bar{b}q$ + 1 positive 2 negative $\bar{b}\bar{b}q$) (electric field penetrating flow 1 positive 2 negative).

#### 3. **Electric Field and Magnetic Field**

- **Electric Field**: The primary polarized flow of void particles associated with charged particles determines the direction of the electric field in positive and negative four-dimensional spaces. Like charges repel each other because their void particle flows in positive and negative four-dimensional spaces move in the same direction, producing peripheral co-directional vortices and local high-pressure effects that cause repulsion. Unlike charges attract because their void particle flows in positive and negative four-dimensional spaces couple together, producing a flow that spans positive and negative four-dimensional spaces. This coupled flow, along with the local low-pressure effect it creates, produces an attraction phenomenon.
- **Electric Current**: The active movement of electrons in the three-dimensional void particle flow formed by the electric field constitutes an electric current.
- **Magnetic Field**: When charged particles' four-dimensional circulations undergo three-dimensional motion, they form a precessional particle vortex perpendicular to the three-dimensional motion direction due to flipping vortices, which we call a "magnetic field".
- **Electromagnetic Force**: The interaction between electric and magnetic fields forms a local spatial gradient pressure in positive and negative four-dimensional spaces, which we call "electromagnetic force".

#### 4. **Light and Wave-Particle Duality**

- **Photon**: A photon is a four-dimensional interface wave produced by collisions between "fate gears" and void particles, propagating through void particles. The peaks and troughs of photons exist in the fourth dimension, with only the middle part existing in three-dimensional space. From the perspective of three-dimensional space, a photon appears as a series of quantum leaps forward. A single photon is both a four-dimensional wave and a quantum leaping forward in three-dimensional space, demonstrating the wave-particle duality of photons.
- **Light**: Light is a cluster of numerous photons, and the propagation behavior of this photon cluster in three-dimensional space exhibits a probability wave consistent with the wavelength and frequency of individual photons, demonstrating the wave-particle duality of light in three-dimensional space.
- **Diffraction and Interference of Light**: The diffraction and interference of light we observe daily are actually caused by the probability wave of light.

### Formation of Forces and Unified Definition of the Four Fundamental Forces

#### 1. **Universal Gravitation**

- **Phenomenon**: Objects exert an attractive force on each other, inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them.
- **Principle**: Universal gravitation arises due to the pressure gradient of void particles in three-dimensional space. Due to the pressure from positive and negative four-dimensional spaces, countless void particles continuously invade three-dimensional space (three-dimensional membrane), forming a uniform three-dimensional expansion pressure, which is the background pressure of void particles in three-dimensional space. The density distribution of void particles in four-dimensional space forms a super-spherical shape around the mass center, decreasing from the center outward. Therefore, the four-dimensional pressure on the three-dimensional membrane also decreases from the center outward, and the number of void particles entering the three-dimensional membrane decreases accordingly. This forms a spherical "incremental" pressure gradient increasing inward around the mass center in three-dimensional space. In three-dimensional space (three-dimensional membrane), the formation of matter primarily consists of large amounts of $bbq$ neutrino composite structures. The aggregation of these $bbq$ structures causes void particles to be continuously extracted from the three-dimensional membrane into four-dimensional space, creating a three-dimensional void low-pressure zone at the mass center. Under the combined action of the three-dimensional void background pressure and the void incremental pressure, a pressure gradient increasing inward and a void particle flow toward the mass center are formed. This three-dimensional void particle flow, together with the four-dimensional invading flow, forms a large-scale four-dimensional gravitational circulation. This four-dimensional invading flow imparts a constant acceleration toward the mass center on all three-dimensional objects within the circulation, independent of the object's mass. Thus, according to Newton's second law F=ma, we calculate the closely related universal gravitation.

#### 2. **Electromagnetic Force**

- **Phenomenon**: There exists an interacting force between charged particles, including attraction and repulsion.
- **Principle**: When charged particles move in three-dimensional space, the electric field also moves, causing the accompanying vortices to move in three-dimensional space. Due to the flipping vortices, a precessional particle vortex perpendicular to the three-dimensional motion direction forms, which we call a "magnetic field". The interaction between electric and magnetic fields forms a local spatial gradient pressure in positive and negative four-dimensional spaces, which we call "electromagnetic force".

#### 3. **Strong Interaction Force**

- **Phenomenon**: The strong interaction force is a type of nuclear force mainly present inside atomic nuclei, responsible for binding protons and neutrons together.
- **Principle**: The strong interaction force is a spatial gradient pressure produced by fluid interactions between jets and vortices of void particles in three-dimensional space. Quarks inside protons and neutrons maintain stability through the exchange of void particle flows, and the void particle flows and vortex systems between up quarks and down quarks form the bond of the strong interaction.

#### 4. **Weak Interaction Force**

- **Phenomenon**: The weak interaction force is a short-range force mainly involved in certain types of radioactive decay processes.
- **Principle**: The weak interaction force arises from unbalanced vortices of void particles in four-dimensional space. Unstable structures like down quarks, when isolated, decay into more stable structures such as up quarks and electrons. The flow and energy transfer of void particles during this decay process manifests as the weak interaction force.

### Appendix: Basic Settings and Derivation Explanations of the Void Universe

#### 1. **Void and Virtual Particles**

- **Void**: Assume void is a structure greater than four-dimensional (corresponding to the bulk universe in string theory), filled with countless basic units called virtual particles.
- **Virtual Particle**: Abbreviated as "virtual particle." Virtual particles possess multidimensional structures, and a stable system composed of numerous virtual particles in the same four-dimensional reference frame is called the void universe.
- **Void Particle**: Abbreviated as "void particle." Void particles are the dimensional reduction products of virtual particles, possessing four-dimensional properties, acting as the medium for all forces and the propagation medium for light.
- **Void Universe**: Refers to the four-dimensional void, i.e., a stable system composed of virtual particles in the same four-dimensional reference frame along with the infinite void particles generated by their dimensional reduction (corresponding to the brane universe in string theory).
- **Material Universe**: Refers to our observable universe, where a three-dimensional space (three-dimensional membrane) with balanced bidirectional four-dimensional pressure in the void universe constitutes the material universe we perceive.

#### 2. **Origin of the Universe**

- **High-Dimensional Collapse**: Assume the universe is formed by the collapse of numerous virtual particles from higher dimensions to lower dimensions, and this process continues.
- **Big Bang**: The big bang occurred due to the collective collapse of the initial high-dimensional particle system into lower dimensions.
- **Fundamental Particles**: After the big bang, a large number of low-dimensional virtual particles were generated, forming the core parts of known fundamental particles.
- **Continuous Dimensional Reduction**: The virtual particles constituting the cores of various fundamental particles continue to undergo dimensional reduction, constantly producing new void particles and releasing energy.
- **Derivation Explanation**:
  - First, based on the manifestations of electricity and magnetism, we speculate that our perceivable universe should possess four-dimensional spatial attributes, implying the possibility of five-dimensional, six-dimensional, or even higher-dimensional existences.
  - Second, the immense number of fundamental particles in the universe leads us to ask: how were they produced from the big bang, akin to a singularity?
  - Considering these factors, the most reasonable source we can find is the dimensional reduction of high-dimensional particles into lower-dimensional universes, allowing for the exponential explosion of low-dimensional particles.
  - Moreover, this process aligns with the principle of entropy increase.
  - Then, how do these nearly identical low-dimensional particles combine into the various fundamental particles in our universe and sustain the system? 
  - This is an entropy-reducing process, necessitating continuous external force intervention.
  - Within this theoretical framework, the most suitable external force we can identify is high-dimensional virtual particles. As long as they continue to undergo dimensional reduction, they can explain the continuous external energy source of our universe.
  - Therefore, summarizing the above, we assume the void is a high-dimensional structure (greater than four-dimensional), filled with countless high-dimensional particles. At some point, these high-dimensional particles underwent a dimensional collapse similar to the big bang, reducing to numerous low-dimensional particles. These low-dimensional particles continue to undergo dimensional reduction, generating infinite four-dimensional fundamental particles, which together form the material universe we perceive.

#### 3. **Characteristics of Virtual Particles**

- **High-Dimensional Virtual Particles**: These dimensionally reduced virtual particles still appear high-dimensional to us and are called high-dimensional virtual particles.
- **High-Energy Oscillation**: High-dimensional virtual particles maintain continuous high-energy oscillations due to the residual waves from the high-dimensional collapse, distributed across all dimensions of the virtual particles.
- **Continuous Dimensional Reduction**: When high-dimensional virtual particles reach the four-dimensional boundary, part of their oscillations may become disturbed, detached, forming a new four-dimensional void particle and releasing partial energy. This is the dimensional reduction process of virtual particles. Alternatively, the oscillations of high-dimensional particles may lose part of their energy upon collision with void particles, leading to the detachment of certain tensors and the formation of a new void particle.

#### 4. **Characteristics of Void Particles**

- **Ubiquitous**: Void particles are the products of dimensional reduction of high-dimensional virtual particles, present in vast quantities, filling the entire four-dimensional void universe.
- **Rigidity**: Two void particles interact with each other only through mutual collisions, exhibiting a space-repelling force akin to rigidity, resulting from the incompatibility of their enclosed energy tensors.
- **Elasticity**: The wave function tensor properties of void particles give them a certain degree of elasticity, physically manifested as compressibility while maintaining static pressure.
- **Force Transmission Medium**: The rigid repulsion of void particles allows them to nearly losslessly exchange kinetic energy, serving as the medium for all known forces.
- **Four-Dimensional Void Pressure**: While individual void particles only exhibit repulsive forces, when countless void particles accumulate, they exhibit fluid dynamics-induced pressure. This pressure originates mainly from ongoing high-dimensional collapse events within the void particle stack, where high-dimensional particle dimensional reduction introduces new void particles and additional energy, providing a stable internal pressure source. Any potential constraint pressure at unknown void boundaries, due to its extreme remoteness, can be temporarily ignored.
- **Three-Dimensional Void Pressure**: The void pressure in three-dimensional space primarily stems from the pressures of positive and negative four-dimensional spaces. Numerous void particles lose their fourth-dimensional kinetic vector after dimensional reduction and invade the three-dimensional space at the four-dimensional zero point, leading to the continuous appearance of new void particles in three-dimensional space. This provides a stable internal pressure source, forming three-dimensional void pressure.
- **Fluidity**: Void particles exhibit sufficient fluidity in four-dimensional space but restricted fluidity in three-dimensional space due to the pressure from positive and negative four-dimensional spaces and the cohesive void pressure caused by the continuous influx of dimensionally reduced void particles. This restriction is key to forming electromagnetism in four-dimensional space (fluid dynamics) and universal gravitation (void pressure) in three-dimensional space.

#### 5. **Four-Dimensional Circulation and Fate Gears**

- **Fate Gear**: The oscillation of virtual particles in four-dimensional space manifests as a rotational cycle resembling a gear spanning three-dimensional space. This serves as the driving core of all physical phenomena, thus named "fate gear".
- **Positive and Negative Fate Gears**: Since the four-dimensional part of virtual particles may reside in either the positive or negative four-dimensional space relative to our three-dimensional space, the "fate gear" can be divided into positive and negative types, which is the origin of matter and antimatter.
- **Circulatory Construct**: When the "fate gear" rotates in three-dimensional space, it carries a large number of void particles, forming a stable unilateral four-dimensional circulatory construct, which serves as the basis of matter.
- **Void Particle Flow**: This four-dimensional circulatory construct manifests in three-dimensional space as void particles appearing and disappearing out of nowhere, forming a more complex hyperspace circulation in four dimensions. This is the root of electromagnetism and mass.
- **Derivation Explanation**:
  - Why does the "fate gear" exist? This was not my original idea but emerged purely as a result of rejecting multiple hypotheses during reverse derivation. Adding this assumption to the model made all other parts of the model unexpectedly self-consistent and perfectly coherent. Everything seemed guided by fate, and since it is the key to the formation of our universe, I named it the "fate gear", symbolizing the destiny of everything in the universe.

#### 6. **Formation of Matter**

- **Core of Virtual Matter**: The fate gear and the four-dimensional void particle circulation system it drives compose the core of matter.
- **Energy of Matter**: The energy of matter is essentially the total electric field energy, i.e., the total kinetic energy of all void particle flows in the four-dimensional circulation structure.
- **Mass of Matter**: Mass describes the total angular momentum resistance formed by the group kinetic energy of all void particle flows in the four-dimensional circulation structure against the motion of matter in three-dimensional space.
- **Essence of Inertia**: The high-dimensional virtual particles at the core of matter, along with the void particle flows they drive, jointly preserve the momentum of inertial motion directions. Through the "fate gear" structure, this momentum is synchronized with all void particles within the system.
- **Relativistic Properties**: An increase in speed or gravity leads to an increase in the density of void particles surrounding the fate gear, increasing the motion resistance, physically manifesting as an increase in relative mass. Faster motion speeds and higher void particle densities mean greater external pressure, prolonging the transient vortex balance around unstable particles, physically manifesting as longer lifetimes, creating the illusion of time dilation. (Microscopic physical processes humans rely on for precise timing are all related to this, hence the conclusion of time dilation.)
- **Universal Gravitation**: The aggregation of a large number of void particles forms a spherical void pressure gradient centered on the mass center, thereby forming universal gravitation.
- **Derivation Explanation**:
  - Analysis of the source of mass shows that mass must correlate positively with the number of void particles. The more void particles aggregate, the greater the void pressure, and thus the stronger the universal gravitation.
  - Mass must be related to the total energy of the void particle flows in the four-dimensional circulation structure, because changing the motion state of an object involves changing the motion state of all particle cores, which means altering the overall motion pattern of the four-dimensional void particle circulation.
  - When a material inertial system moves rapidly, it collides with more void particles. Assuming these void particles are relatively stationary, the relative speed between the fate gear and these void particles equals the speed of the inertial system. This is equivalent to forming a new void particle circulation around the fate gear in three-dimensional space. The faster the inertial system moves, the faster the speed of this void particle flow. When the speed of the inertial system matches the speed of the four-dimensional void particle circulation, it is equivalent to adding another identical void particle circulation system. This means that to change the motion state of the inertial system, twice the energy cost is required, effectively doubling the mass.
  - Faster motion speeds and higher void particle densities imply greater external pressure, prolonging the transient vortex balance around unstable particles, thus extending their lifetimes, corresponding to the time dilation effects in special and general relativity.
  - The ultra-long-distance action of universal gravitation essentially rules out the possibility of it being a pull-type force transmitted by some kind of graviton. From the start, I attempted to interpret universal gravitation as a pressure-type force almost universally covering all directions. Through reverse derivation, I eventually found a matching model, namely the void pressure produced by the void particles filling the entire universe.

- **High-Energy Oscillation**: High-dimensional virtual particles maintain continuous high-energy oscillations due to the residual waves from the high-dimensional collapse, distributed across all dimensions of the virtual particles.
- **Continuous Dimensional Reduction**: When high-dimensional virtual particles reach the four-dimensional boundary, part of their oscillations may become disturbed, detached, forming a new four-dimensional void particle and releasing part of their energy. This is the dimensional reduction process of virtual particles. It could also be that the oscillations of high-dimensional particles lose part of their energy upon collision with void particles, leading to the detachment of certain tensors and the formation of a new void particle.

This pressure primarily originates from ongoing high-dimensional collapse events within the void particle stack, where high-dimensional particle dimensional reduction introduces new void particles and additional energy, providing a stable internal pressure source. Any potential constraint pressure at unknown void boundaries, due to its extreme remoteness, can be temporarily ignored.
- **Three-Dimensional Void Pressure**: The void pressure in three-dimensional space primarily stems from the pressures of positive and negative four-dimensional spaces. Numerous void particles lose their fourth-dimensional kinetic vectors after dimensional reduction and invade the three-dimensional space at the four-dimensional zero point, leading to the continuous appearance of new void particles in three-dimensional space. This provides a stable internal pressure source, forming three-dimensional void pressure.
- **Fluidity**: Void particles exhibit sufficient fluidity in four-dimensional space but restricted fluidity in three-dimensional space due to the pressure from positive and negative four-dimensional spaces and the cohesive void pressure caused by the continuous influx of dimensionally reduced void particles. This restriction is crucial to forming electromagnetism in four-dimensional space (fluid dynamics) and universal gravitation (void pressure) in three-dimensional space.

#### 5. **Four-Dimensional Circulation and Fate Gears**

- **Fate Gear**: The oscillation of virtual particles in four-dimensional space manifests as a rotational cycle resembling a gear spanning three-dimensional space. This serves as the driving core of all physical phenomena, thus named "fate gear".
