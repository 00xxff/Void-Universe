#### Deflection of Light

Near strong gravitational fields, light rays bend. Based on our previous conjectures about the generation and propagation of light, we posited that light propagates through void particles, whose density determines its speed. Thus, we infer that spatial curvature caused by gravity is actually changes in the density of void particles, leading to the twisted propagation paths of light quanta, which results in gravitational lensing phenomena.

Additionally, within the void sphere gravity zone of matter, void particles flow from the boundary of the gravity zone toward the mass center. The velocity of void particle streams generated by four-dimensional intrusion should equal the velocity of three-dimensional void particle streams at the point of intrusion. If an object moves toward the mass center with a speed greater than or equal to the speed of the three-dimensional void particle stream, the gravitational acceleration it experiences is produced only by the incremental pressure from four-dimensional intrusion. Therefore, the velocity of void particle streams generated by four-dimensional intrusion should equal the gravitational acceleration at the point of intrusion, and the velocity of the three-dimensional void particle stream also equals the gravitational acceleration. When gravitational acceleration near a black hole exceeds the speed of light, light inside cannot escape, and external light deflects toward the black hole's center due to the superluminal void particle stream, forming the event horizon of a black hole.

Based on this inference, if a black hole rotates at high speed, its void particle streams also rotate with it. Given that gravitational acceleration near a black hole approaches or even exceeds the speed of light, this rotating void particle stream can approach or exceed the speed of light, likely creating two lower centripetal velocity vortex cavities at the poles, allowing some high-energy rays to escape from the black hole's poles.

#### Time Dilation

In strong gravitational fields, time passes more slowly. Similar to explanations for phenomena in special relativity, within a gravitational field, stronger gravity means higher density of void particles and faster flow speeds toward the mass center. Unstable particle structures within the gravitational field can thus maintain their state for longer periods (longer lifetimes), creating the illusion of time dilation. This aligns with our hypothesis regarding the principles underlying special relativity phenomena. The same logic applies to gravitational mass.

#### Gravitational Waves

In the ocean of void particles, when two supermassive high-density mass systems, each carrying relatively stationary high-density void spheres, rapidly rotate and collide, this causes numerous high-density void particles in three-dimensional space to move at high speeds, resulting in compression and collisions. These disturbances propagate outward as longitudinal waves. Since the speed of force transmission between void particles is the speed of light, gravitational waves also travel at the speed of light.
