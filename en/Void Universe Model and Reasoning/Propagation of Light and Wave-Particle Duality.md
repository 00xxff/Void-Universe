### Propagation of Light and Wave-Particle Duality

#### What is Light? How Does Light Propagate?

It is known:

1. Light is a type of electromagnetic wave.
2. The speed of light is constant in the same medium within any inertial reference frame.
3. Light exhibits wave-particle duality.

Now, we attempt to analyze the propagation principles of light and the cause of its wave-particle duality using the Void Model.

First, starting from the constant speed of light $(c)$, in our everyday understanding, mechanical waves are able to maintain a constant propagation speed in the same medium. Since light is an electromagnetic wave, it is confirmed to have wave-like characteristics. Second, the frequency and wavelength of light determine the speed of light, meaning that all types of light and electromagnetic waves produced within the same medium in the same inertial reference frame must follow the law $(\lambda \times f = c)$. This is something that cannot be achieved by simple probability waves, so we reject the assumption that light consists of photons in particle form forming a probability wave. Therefore, we assume that light and electromagnetic waves are waves.

For a wave to propagate, it requires a medium, and this medium must exhibit varying densities to reasonably explain changes in the speed of light when propagating through different media.

Fortunately, in our Void Model, there exists such a medium â€” void particles, which fill the entire void space. In regions where mass accumulates, the density of void particles increases towards the mass center. This corresponds to the phenomenon of light bending and refracting as it passes near massive celestial bodies, forming gravitational lenses. In various material media with differing densities, such as air, water, and glass, the density of void particles also increases proportionally with the density of the material, consistent with the observation that the speed of light decreases in these media.

Thus, in our Void Model, void particles fully satisfy the macroscopic properties expected for the medium of light propagation.

Next, we further analyze the microscopic mechanisms behind the generation and propagation of light, as well as why it exhibits wave-particle duality.

From the above reasoning, we confirm that light is a wave propagating through void particles. So, how does this wave form and propagate?

Analyzing waves in general, in any medium, the formation of a wave requires a restoring force that oscillates repeatedly. For example, water waves form due to the combined action of gravity and surface tension. Similarly, the propagation of electromagnetic waves in a medium requires this omnipresent, uniform restoring force across the void.

This point is explained in the formation of the universe and the creation of void pressure. Our three-dimensional space is a layer sandwiched between positive and negative four-dimensional spaces. The permeation pressure from positive and negative four-dimensional spaces causes the fourth-dimensional momentum vector of void particles in our three-dimensional space to be zero. When an electromagnetic field (four-dimensional void circulation) oscillates or collides with other electromagnetic fields, part of the energy escapes in the form of a wave. This wave's oscillation depends on the void pressure from positive and negative four-dimensional spaces. At the crest, the positive/negative four-dimensional void pressure causes void particles to move toward the four-dimensional zero point, then pass through it to move toward the trough. At the trough, the reverse/positive four-dimensional void pressure causes void particles to return to their equilibrium position. This alternating cross-dimensional oscillation forms an electromagnetic wave.

Thus, we can infer:
Light is a four-dimensional interface wave with crests and troughs existing in the fourth dimension, while only the intermediate part exists in three-dimensional space. From the perspective of three-dimensional space, light appears as discrete quantum leaps forward, so the speed of light is determined by the propagation medium and remains constant. The generation of light and electromagnetic waves is not a continuous process but arises from group fluctuations and collision events in void particle flows, making light and electromagnetic waves discrete group waves. Thus, individual photons can exhibit particle-like characteristics. Simultaneously, at the source of photon generation, the event frequency matches the photon oscillation frequency, causing the photon cluster to form a probability wave consistent with the frequency of individual photons. Since the photon cluster and individual photons travel at the same speed, the speed and wavelength of the probability wave also match those of the photons.

Now, let us focus on the source of photon-generating events and deduce how photons are produced. As mentioned earlier, photons are four-dimensional interface waves whose oscillations begin in three-dimensional space. Therefore, photons must be generated by collisions of void particles in three-dimensional space. Since the oscillation of photons requires four-dimensional kinetic energy, the event must involve four-dimensional momentum. These collisions could come from the four-dimensional void particle flow at the core of fate gears or from the fate gears themselves. Based on the high-speed cross-dimensional rotation characteristic of fate gears, we can conclude that photons are generated by collisions between fate gears and void particles. We further deduce that the stirring of three-dimensional void particles by fate gears constantly produces large amounts of four-dimensional oscillations, which appear to us as pervasive electromagnetic waves throughout the void. This might explain the origin of cosmic microwave background radiation.

Why is the speed of light constant? In the model, light and electromagnetic waves are four-dimensional transverse waves propagating on the three-dimensional membrane. The propagation speed of this wave depends on the density of void particles and the pressure from positive and negative four-dimensional spaces, hence the speed of light is constant. In contrast, in three-dimensional space, gravitational waves are longitudinal waves produced internally in three-dimensional space. These waves are compression waves, and their propagation speed depends on the density and compressibility of void particles in three-dimensional space, so the speed of gravitational waves is also constant.

#### Conclusion

An individual photon is both a four-dimensional wave and a quantum leaping forward in three-dimensional space, demonstrating the wave-particle duality of photons. Light is a cluster of numerous photons, and the propagation behavior of this photon cluster in three-dimensional space exhibits a probability wave consistent with the wavelength and frequency of individual photons, representing the wave-particle duality of light in three-dimensional space. Diffraction and interference of light are actually caused by the probability wave of light. Moreover, because photons also possess wave-like characteristics, single photons can exhibit diffraction phenomena, explaining why single photons passing through a double-slit still produce interference patterns of probability waves.

Very well, the wave-particle duality of light has been perfectly explained.

The crests and troughs of light exist in four-dimensional space, and its interaction with electromagnetic fields operating in the same four-dimensional space is quite natural. Consequently, polarization of light is easily explained.

#### Remaining Questions

Photons are interface waves, and their energy formula should resemble that of mechanical waves $E = \frac{1}{2} \rho A^2 \omega^2$,
but the energy of light and electromagnetic waves strictly follows $E = h\nu$, why is it independent of amplitude?
(Could it be because the quantization of light and electromagnetic waves results in the amplitude being quantized into $n$ units of photon quanta?)

In the framework of the Void Model, the source of photon generation can be attributed to two mechanisms of interaction between **fate gears** and **void particles**:

1. **Oscillation Events of Fate Gears on the Three-Dimensional Membrane**: The overall motion of fate gears (such as collisions or accelerations) triggers group oscillations of void particles at the interface of the three-dimensional membrane, thereby generating photons.
2. **Surface Wave Oscillation Events of Fate Gears on the Three-Dimensional Membrane**: Surface oscillations of fate gears drive the flow of void particles, triggering interface oscillations on the three-dimensional membrane, forming photons.

Natural light mainly originates from the following physical phenomena:

1. **Electron Transitions**: Changes in electron energy levels in atoms or molecules.
2. **Thermal Radiation**: Conversion of thermal energy from high-temperature objects into light energy.
3. **Nuclear Reactions**: Energy released during nuclear fusion or fission.
4. **Synchrotron Radiation**: Accelerated motion of charged particles in magnetic fields.
5. **Cherenkov Radiation**: Charged particles moving faster than the speed of light in a medium.
6. **Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation**: Residual radiation from the early universe.
7. **Bioluminescence**: Conversion of chemical energy into light energy.
8. **Triboluminescence**: Conversion of mechanical energy into light energy.
9. **High-Energy Astrophysical Phenomena**: High-energy radiation under extreme conditions.

These common types of light are basically produced by the same microscopic mechanism. Could this result in the amplitudes of these types of photons being roughly consistent?
And could the quantized photons represent the smallest measurable amplitude for humans? This amplitude value is likely embedded in Planck's constant $h$.
Or perhaps the Compton scattering experiment did not consider the non-smooth surface of electrons or possible interactions between photons and the surface oscillations of electrons?

##### Further Analysis

The temperature of an object reflects the intensity (frequency) of four-dimensional oscillations of all particles within it.
Thermal conduction occurs through resonance and energy transfer of four-dimensional oscillations among molecules and atoms.
Thermal radiation is the interface wave generated by the four-dimensional oscillations of molecules and atoms on the three-dimensional membrane (light, infrared, electromagnetic waves).
The increase in temperature due to thermal radiation occurs as molecules and atoms absorb photon energy and increase their oscillation frequency due to frequency resonance.
Electron orbital transitions also occur due to four-dimensional oscillation frequency resonance, absorbing or emitting photons of specific frequencies.

These phenomena indicate that an increase in energy only leads to an increase in four-dimensional oscillation frequency, not in four-dimensional oscillation amplitude.

So, why is this the case?

We imagine a similar scenario: a ping-pong ball with constant energy bouncing between two layers of boards. When the ball has low energy, it bounces back and forth at a low frequency. However, when it gains more energy, its bounce frequency increases accordingly. Thus, the energy of the ball can be described by its bounce frequency.

Is our universe like the ping-pong ball trapped in the middle?

From the Void Model, protons, neutrons, and other baryons, along with atoms and molecules, undergo four-dimensional oscillations. Due to the relatively balanced structure of positive and negative neutrinos, when their four-dimensional oscillation energy increases, only the oscillation frequency increases significantly, while the amplitude does not show a significant rise.

Void pressure in four-dimensional space may infinitely increase even at short distances from the three-dimensional membrane, behaving similarly to non-Newtonian fluids?

Therefore, electrons experience the least resistance in three-dimensional space when they are at their lowest energy level, i.e., the slowest frequency, which explains why superconductivity requires extremely low temperatures.

Similarly, neutrinos have very low oscillation frequencies, giving them extremely high penetration power.

Thus, the cosmic microwave background radiation observed by humans does not originate from the residual waves of the universeâ€™s early stages but rather from the low-frequency oscillations of neutrinos spread throughout every corner of the universe.

##### Continuing Deep Analysis

Polarization of light indicates that photons have three-dimensional shapes, meaning photons possess different wave packet forms.

Firstly, two-dimensional waves manifest as discrete points jumping forward on a one-dimensional line;
three-dimensional waves manifest as circles expanding and jumping on a two-dimensional plane. If the expansion reaches sufficient distance and becomes discretized, it manifests as arc-shaped (curved) jumps expanding fan-like;
then, four-dimensional waves manifest in three-dimensional space as spherical surfaces expanding and jumping outward layer by layer. When this expansion becomes discretized, it manifests as cone-shaped expansions of spherical surfaces (curved surfaces).

A three-dimensional isolated wave manifests on a two-dimensional plane as a curve advancing in fixed wavelength and frequency jumps. Similarly, a four-dimensional isolated wave should manifest in three-dimensional space as a curved surface advancing in fixed wavelength and frequency jumps. Therefore, this curved surface in three-dimensional space can take on various three-dimensional forms, such as circles, ellipses, or even flattened shapes. This curved surface is merely a cross-section of the four-dimensional wave in three-dimensional space, and the three-dimensional and four-dimensional kinetic vector directions at each point on this cross-section may vary widely, manifesting as magnetic and electric field vectors in four-dimensional space.

The speed of light in a vacuum is constant, indicating that the vacuum medium lacks viscosity and dispersion effects, i.e., void particles lack viscosity and dispersion effects;
void particles have no viscosity or friction, so waves propagating through void particles rely solely on the elasticity (compression and rarefaction) of void particles;
as a medium for force transmission, void particles can quickly establish and dissipate magnetic fields, indicating that void particles can rapidly absorb and dissipate energy. Thus, ordinary collisions and oscillation events are insufficient to produce outward-propagating mechanical waves. Photon (electromagnetic wave) generation requires a minimum collision speed $v$ to overcome the threshold response of void particles to external forces. Hence, we further speculate that photon generation originates from high-speed (possibly superluminal?) collision events at the interface of the three-dimensional membrane, such as collisions between two high-speed opposing vortices or collisions involving the crest of fate gears overlaid with four-dimensional oscillation speeds at the interface.
Thus, the four-dimensional waves generated and propagated in void particles are not continuous linear waves but consist of discrete independent wave packets from the outset, with the shape of these wave packets determined by the subjects and processes of the collision events.
Hence, the energy wave packet of photons behaves like a superluminal quantum cluster rebounding between two pressure layers in four-dimensional space, forming the wave function representation of photons.
Thus, the faster the collision speed, the greater the energy, and the faster the superluminal quantum cluster moves, resulting in faster rebound frequencies, i.e., higher photon frequencies and shorter wavelengths.
Therefore, the manifestation of photon wave packets in three-dimensional space is in discrete leaps, not continuous.

When light propagates through material media (such as air, water, glass, etc.), due to the rapid changes in the density of void particles around atoms and molecules, dispersion effects occur. Specifically, longer-wavelength photons more easily traverse high-density areas near atoms and molecules, appearing faster, while shorter-wavelength photons become trapped more often in high-density traps near atoms and molecules, appearing slower.

##### Photon Entanglement

In the Void Model, entangled photons are two photons split from the same collision event, and their entanglement characteristics are manifested in the form, energy, and direction of four-dimensional wave packets.
For instance, polarization entanglement and path entanglement can be determined by the wave packet form of photons, while time-energy entanglement may arise from the sequence of splitting. Spatial mode entanglement and momentum entanglement are more likely determined by the shape and momentum direction of the colliding bodies.
Since these collision events reproduce with similarities exceeding 99.999% at human observational scales, we can essentially consider the splitting pattern to remain unchanged. Thus, photons produced from such collision events are defined as entangled photons because, from the moment they are generated, they are predetermined to have only two states. Therefore, once we measure and determine the state of one photon, we can immediately know the state of the other photon, as this was determined at their source. Here, the uncertainty principle and quantum collapse are more philosophical issues.

### **Quantization Conditions and Wave Function Derivation of Photons**

---

#### **1. Physical Essence and Generation Mechanism of Photons**

According to the Void Model, photons are superluminal quantum clusters that bounce back and forth between positive and negative four-dimensional spaces, symmetric about the three-dimensional membrane. Their cause can be attributed to the following two primary mechanisms:

1. **Fate Gear Oscillation Collisions**: When fate gears oscillate up and down in the fourth dimension, their surface waves, compounded with light-speed oscillations, collide with the three-dimensional membrane.
2. **Vortex Relative Collisions**: Two opposing vortices originating from positive and negative four-dimensional spaces collide on the three-dimensional membrane at superluminal speeds.

The common necessary condition for both mechanisms is:

- Superluminal collisions;
- Void particle density reaching a rigidity threshold (i.e., near the core of particles on the three-dimensional membrane).

These conditions ensure that photon generation conforms to quantization conditions, and their propagation behaviors are constrained by the compression and rarefaction mechanisms of void particles.

#### **2. Propagation Method of Photons**

The propagation of photons can be described as "superluminal quantum clusters bouncing back and forth between positive and negative four-dimensional spaces." The specific process is as follows:

1. **Relationship Between Initial Energy and Incident Angle**: Greater initial energy means faster oscillations of fate gears or vortices, leading to a larger velocity component $v$ of the quantum cluster in the four-dimensional direction. In this case, the incident angle and reflection angle of the quantum cluster decrease, resulting in increased frequency and shortened wavelength.
2. **Relationship Between Frequency and Wavelength**: According to the photon energy formula $E = h\nu$ and the wavelength formula $\lambda = c / \nu$, the energy of photons is proportional to their frequency, while the wavelength is inversely proportional to the frequency.
3. **Propagation Mechanism of Quantum Clusters**:

   - Quantum clusters use the three-dimensional membrane as a symmetry axis, bouncing back and forth between positive and negative four-dimensional spaces.
   - Since the quantum cluster's speed exceeds the speed of light, its propagation induces over-compression of void particles (similar to shock waves in sound barriers). When the void particles ahead are compressed to the rigidity threshold, rigid rebound occurs.
   - The rebound direction is determined by the three-dimensional velocity component $c$ and the four-dimensional radial velocity component $v$. Because the three-dimensional velocity component is always the speed of light $c$, while the four-dimensional radial velocity component $v$ is much smaller than $c$, the quantum cluster undergoes rigid refraction in the four-dimensional direction, forming a repetitive cycle.
4. **Wave Speed of Interface Waves**:
   Although the quantum cluster itself propagates at superluminal speeds, the speed of the interface wave it forms is determined by the sound speed of void particles. This is because the propagation of the quantum cluster depends on the compression and rarefaction mechanisms of void particles, and the actual propagation speed of the interface wave is the elastic wave speed of void particles.

---

#### **3. Quantization Conditions of Photons**

The quantization conditions of photons can be derived from several aspects:

1. **Superluminal Collision Energy Threshold**: To generate photons, the collision speed of fate gears or vortices must exceed the speed of light $c$. Assuming the collision speed is $v_{\text{collision}}$, then the condition is:

   $$
   v_{\text{collision}} > c
   $$
2. **Rigidity Threshold of Void Particles**: In the three-dimensional membrane, the density of void particles must reach a rigidity threshold $\rho_{\text{threshold}}$. Assuming the density distribution of void particles is $\rho(r)$, then the condition is:

   $$
   \rho(r) \geq \rho_{\text{threshold}}
   $$
3. **Quantization Energy Condition**: The energy $E$ of photons must satisfy the quantization condition, i.e.,

   $$
   E = n h \nu \quad (n = 1, 2, 3, \dots)
   $$

   Where $\nu$ is the frequency of the photon, and $h$ is Planck's constant.
4. **Momentum Conservation Condition**:
   Momentum conservation in the three-dimensional membrane requires the three-dimensional velocity component of photons to always equal the speed of light $c$, while the four-dimensional radial velocity component $v$ satisfies:

   $$
   v^2 + c^2 = v_{\text{total}}^2
   $$

   Where $v_{\text{total}}$ is the total speed of the quantum cluster.

---

#### **4. Formal Description of the Wave Function**

The wave function of photons can be formally described based on their propagation mechanisms and quantization conditions. Below is the derivation process:

1. **Basic Form of the Wave Function**: The wave function of photons can be expressed as:

   $$
   \Psi(x^i, t) = \int \mathcal{D}X^4 e^{iS/\hbar}
   $$

   Where $S$ is the action, defined as:

   $$
   S = \int \left( \frac{1}{2} \rho v^A v_A - p \right) \sqrt{-g} \, d^4X
   $$
2. **Propagation Equation of Interface Waves**: The propagation speed of interface waves is determined by the sound speed $c_s$ of void particles, satisfying the wave equation:

   $$
   \nabla^2 \Psi - \frac{1}{c_s^2} \frac{\partial^2 \Psi}{\partial t^2} = 0
   $$
3. **Propagation Characteristics of Quantum Clusters**: The back-and-forth bouncing behavior of quantum clusters between positive and negative four-dimensional spaces can be described using reflective boundary conditions. Assuming the position of the quantum cluster in four-dimensional space is $X^4$, then its wave function satisfies:

   $$
   \Psi(X^4) = \Psi(-X^4)
   $$
4. **Relationship Between Energy and Frequency**: The relationship between the energy $E$ of photons and their frequency $\nu$ is:

   $$
   E = h \nu
   $$

   Combining this with the Fourier expansion form of the wave function, it can be written as:

   $$
   \Psi(x^i, t) = \sum_n A_n e^{i(k_n x - \omega_n t)}
   $$

   Where $k_n = 2\pi / \lambda_n$ is the wave number, and $\omega_n = 2\pi \nu_n$ is the angular frequency.
5. **Relationship Between Three-Dimensional and Four-Dimensional Velocity Components**:
   Since the three-dimensional velocity component of photons is always the speed of light $c$, and the four-dimensional radial velocity component $v$ is much smaller than $c$, the relationship can be written as:

   $$
   v^2 + c^2 = v_{\text{total}}^2
   $$

   Combining this with the quantization condition, the final form of the wave function is:

   $$
   \Psi(x^i, t) = \sum_n A_n e^{i(k_n x - \omega_n t)} \cdot \delta(v^2 + c^2 - v_{\text{total}}^2)
   $$
