### Electron Orbital Energy Levels

In the void model, the energy levels of an electron's orbit can be understood as its vibrational modes in four-dimensional space. Electrons, under the action of four-dimensional kinetic vectors, generate vibrations in four dimensions similar to photons. These vibrational modes determine the energy state of the electron in three-dimensional space.

#### Electron's Four-Dimensional Vibrational Modes

The vibrational mode of an electron in four-dimensional space resembles the four-dimensional vibration of photons, except that the vibrational modes of electrons contain more dimensional information. Electrons can have different frequencies of four-dimensional vibrations, corresponding to different energy levels of the electron.

#### Relationship Between Energy Level and Vibration Frequency

The energy level of an electron is proportional to its vibration frequency. The higher the energy level, the higher the frequency of the electron's vibration in four-dimensional space. This high-frequency vibration increases the proportion of time the electron spends in four-dimensional space, which results in faster movement of the electron in three-dimensional space. Thus, the higher the energy level, the faster the electron moves in three-dimensional space.

### Electron Transition

Electron transition refers to the change of an electron from one vibrational mode to another, accompanied by the absorption or release of energy.

#### Transition During Photon Absorption

When an electron absorbs a photon, the energy carried by the photon increases the frequency of the electron's four-dimensional vibration. This process can be seen as the electron transitioning from a lower-frequency vibrational mode to a higher-frequency vibrational mode. As the vibration frequency increases, the proportion of time the electron spends in four-dimensional space increases, leading to faster movement of the electron in three-dimensional space, thus transitioning to a higher energy level.

#### Transition During Photon Emission

When an electron transitions from a higher-frequency vibrational mode to a lower-frequency vibrational mode, the frequency of the electron's vibration in four-dimensional space decreases. During this process, the proportion of time the electron spends in four-dimensional space decreases, leading to slower movement of the electron in three-dimensional space, accompanied by the emission of a photon whose energy equals the difference between the two vibrational modes.

### Absorption and Emission of Photons of the Same Frequency

Electrons can absorb and emit photons of the same frequency because the four-dimensional vibrational modes of the electron match those of the photon. When an electron absorbs a photon, the vibrational mode of the electron synchronizes with the vibrational mode of the photon, causing the electron to transition to a higher energy level. When the electron transitions from a higher energy level to a lower energy level, the vibrational mode of the electron matches again, resulting in the emission of a photon of the same frequency.

### Combining Electron Orbital Energy Levels and Transition Phenomenon

In the void model, the energy levels of an electron's orbit can be understood as the vibrational modes of the electron in four-dimensional space. The quantum superposition state of the electron manifests as fluctuations among multiple possible vibrational modes. When an electron absorbs or emits a photon, the four-dimensional vibrational mode of the electron changes, causing the electron to transition from one energy level to another.

### Summary

Within the framework of the void model, the energy levels of an electron's orbit can be explained as the vibrational modes of the electron in four-dimensional space. The energy level of an electron is proportional to its four-dimensional vibration frequencyâ€”the higher the energy level, the higher the vibration frequency, and the faster the electron moves in three-dimensional space. Electron transition is the process of the electron changing from one vibrational mode to another, accompanied by the absorption or emission of energy, manifesting as the absorption or emission of a photon. Electrons can absorb and emit photons of the same frequency because the four-dimensional vibrational modes of the electron match those of the photon.
