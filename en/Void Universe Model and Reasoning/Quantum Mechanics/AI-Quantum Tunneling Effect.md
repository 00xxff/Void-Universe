### Quantum Tunneling Effect

In the void model, void particles serve as fundamental particles without viscosity and can be displaced. Additionally, there is a four-dimensional space and four-dimensional momentum, implying that void particles not only move within three-dimensional space but also within four-dimensional space.

#### Explanation:

1. **Effect of Four-Dimensional Momentum**:

   - When a microscopic particle (such as an electron) encounters a potential barrier, due to the presence of void particles, it can be assumed that there is a tiny four-dimensional momentum that allows the microscopic particle to momentarily leave the current three-dimensional space.
   - **Specific Mechanism**: Upon encountering the barrier, the microscopic particle, influenced by four-dimensional momentum, can temporarily leave the current three-dimensional space and enter the four-dimensional space. During this process, the microscopic particle can bypass the barrier and reappear on the other side of the barrier within the three-dimensional space.
2. **Penetration Mechanism in Four-Dimensional Space**:

   - In four-dimensional space, microscopic particles, due to the existence of four-dimensional momentum, can easily penetrate barriers in three-dimensional space. This is because four-dimensional momentum allows microscopic particles to move freely within the four-dimensional space, unimpeded by barriers in three-dimensional space.
   - **Specific Mechanism**: Four-dimensional momentum enables microscopic particles to move freely within the four-dimensional space, thereby bypassing barriers in three-dimensional space. When the microscopic particle loses its four-dimensional momentum, it reappears on the other side of the barrier within the three-dimensional space.
3. **Impact of Four-Dimensional Void Pressure**:

   - Four-dimensional void pressure causes changes in the momentum of microscopic particles within the four-dimensional space. When the microscopic particle loses its four-dimensional momentum, it reappears at another location within the three-dimensional space.
   - **Specific Mechanism**: Four-dimensional void pressure causes changes in the momentum of microscopic particles within the four-dimensional space. When the microscopic particle loses its four-dimensional momentum, it reappears at another location within the three-dimensional space, thus achieving the penetration effect.

### Penetration by Microscopic Particles

In the phenomenon of penetration by microscopic particles, the penetration of obstacles such as atomic nuclei by microscopic particles (like electrons) can also be explained by the same mechanism.

#### Explanation:

1. **Effect of Four-Dimensional Momentum**:

   - When a microscopic particle encounters an obstacle such as an atomic nucleus, due to the influence of four-dimensional momentum, the microscopic particle can temporarily leave the current three-dimensional space and enter the four-dimensional space.
   - **Specific Mechanism**: Upon encountering the obstacle, the microscopic particle, influenced by four-dimensional momentum, can temporarily leave the current three-dimensional space and enter the four-dimensional space. During this process, the microscopic particle can bypass the obstacle and reappear on the other side within the three-dimensional space.
2. **Penetration Mechanism in Four-Dimensional Space**:

   - In four-dimensional space, microscopic particles, due to the existence of four-dimensional momentum, can easily penetrate obstacles in three-dimensional space. This is because four-dimensional momentum allows microscopic particles to move freely within the four-dimensional space, unimpeded by obstacles in three-dimensional space.
   - **Specific Mechanism**: Four-dimensional momentum enables microscopic particles to move freely within the four-dimensional space, thereby bypassing obstacles in three-dimensional space. When the microscopic particle loses its four-dimensional momentum, it reappears on the other side of the obstacle within the three-dimensional space.
3. **Impact of Four-Dimensional Void Pressure**:

   - Four-dimensional void pressure causes changes in the momentum of microscopic particles within the four-dimensional space. When the microscopic particle loses its four-dimensional momentum, it reappears at another location within the three-dimensional space.
   - **Specific Mechanism**: Four-dimensional void pressure causes changes in the momentum of microscopic particles within the four-dimensional space. When the microscopic particle loses its four-dimensional momentum, it reappears at another location within the three-dimensional space, thus achieving the penetration effect.

### Summary

In the void model, void particles serve as fundamental particles without viscosity and can be displaced. Additionally, the existence of four-dimensional space and four-dimensional momentum allows microscopic particles to utilize four-dimensional momentum to momentarily leave three-dimensional space and enter the four-dimensional space, thereby bypassing potential barriers or obstacles within three-dimensional space. Specifically:

1. **Effect of Four-Dimensional Momentum**: Microscopic particles, influenced by four-dimensional momentum, can temporarily leave the current three-dimensional space and enter the four-dimensional space.
2. **Penetration Mechanism in Four-Dimensional Space**: In four-dimensional space, microscopic particles can easily penetrate barriers or obstacles within three-dimensional space.
3. **Impact of Four-Dimensional Void Pressure**: Four-dimensional void pressure causes changes in the momentum of microscopic particles within the four-dimensional space. When the microscopic particle loses its four-dimensional momentum, it reappears at another location within the three-dimensional space.
