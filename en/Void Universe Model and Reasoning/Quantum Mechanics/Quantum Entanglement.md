### **Quantum Entanglement**

The entanglement of two particles arises from their interaction, which establishes identical or related four-dimensional momentum structures, allowing them to be described by the same or related (joint) wave functions. The wave functions of the two entangled particles are determined at the moment they establish their entangled state. After they separate, they no longer influence each other, and there is no transmission of information between them. Instead, it is the mathematical structure of the wave function itself that determines their statistical behavior.

#### **Photon Entanglement**

In the Void Model, entangled photons are the result of two photons splitting from the same collision event. Their entanglement characteristics are manifested in the shape, energy, and direction of their four-dimensional wave packets. For example:
- Polarization entanglement and path entanglement can be determined by the shape of the photon's wave packet.
- Time-energy entanglement may arise from the sequence of their splitting.
- Spatial pattern entanglement and momentum entanglement are more likely determined by the shape and momentum direction of the colliding entities.
Since these collision events reproduce with a similarity rate exceeding 99.999% on the scale observable by humans, we can generally assume that the splitting pattern remains constant. Therefore, the photons produced by such collision events are defined as entangled photons. From the moment they are generated, these photons are destined to have only two possible states. Thus, whenever we measure the state of one photon, we can immediately determine the state of the other photon. This relationship is established at the source of their creation, and the uncertainty principle and quantum collapse are more philosophical issues in this context rather than physical ones.

#### **Bell's Inequality**

In 2016, the Big Bell Test demonstrated that Bell's inequality does not hold. In our model, this experimental result can be explained as follows: 
When measuring high-dimensional quantum states, there is an issue of information loss when reducing to lower-dimensional results. If the actual state of the entangled particles exists in higher-dimensional space, then the low-dimensional measurement results may represent projections of high-dimensional information. These projections could lead to deviations in the probabilities of certain outcome combinations compared to the predictions of classical hidden variable theories (i.e., non-random outcomes), thereby violating Bell's inequality. The failure of Bell's inequality may therefore be due to statistical effects caused by high-dimensional projections rather than being a unique property of quantum entanglement.
Each photon's wave function is relatively independent, but for entangled photons, there exists a correlation in their wave functions. Statistically, they can be considered as different aspects of the same photon. Using two polarizers set at fixed angles to sequentially measure the two entangled photons is analogous to a single photon passing through two polarizers set at fixed angles. Hence, the probability of the result is $P = \cos^2\theta$.

#### **Photon "Survivor Bias"**

Firstly, light is composed of a large number of photons forming a probability wave. The polarization type and direction of light are derived from the statistical measurement results of the photon cluster's probability wave. Therefore, the polarization type and direction of light do not represent the polarization type and direction of individual photons. When using a polarizer to measure the polarization of light, the blocked photons are consumed and cannot be measured again. As a result, we cannot obtain the precise polarization state of a single photon. Instead, we can only determine the probability of the photon cluster passing through the polarizer. This phenomenon is referred to as the "survivor bias" of photons.
For example:
Assume that the polarization type and direction of photons are asymmetric in three-dimensional space. Thus, when measuring photons from different angles in three-dimensional space, the probability of a photon passing through the polarizer is not uniform.
Suppose one photon has a 70% probability of passing through the polarizer at any angle, while another photon has a 30% probability. When they appear in equal proportions, we measure that this beam of light has a 50% probability of passing through the polarizer at any angle. If we assume that the wave functions of these photons are identical to the wave function of the light, we conclude that these photons have a 50% probability of passing through the polarizer at any angle. However, since the "sacrificed" photons cannot "speak for themselves," this represents the "survivor bias" of photons (being averaged out).

What impact does this situation have on the results of Bell's inequality?
When measuring a pair of entangled photons, the situation changes. Originally isolated photons now have a "twin brother," meaning we can effectively perform two measurements on one photon. Consequently, the correlation probability of the measurement results for each pair of entangled photons directly corresponds to the theoretical measurement probability of the actual polarization state of the photons.
If we only look at the measurement results from one end, the probability distribution of all photon measurement results remains random and conforms to the photon's wave function distribution.
However, the correlation probability of the measurement results from a large number of pairs of entangled photons reflects the probability of light passing through two polarizers set at fixed angles consecutively.
