### Quantum Superposition

How can quantum superposition be explained?

One possible explanation is that the core of a particle is perpetually traversed by ultra-fast four-dimensional void particle flows. Under such conditions, the particleâ€™s core might be deflected from the current three-dimensional space by positive and negative four-dimensional momenta, and then oscillate back and forth due to the pressure of the four-dimensional void, similar to the oscillation of light. This makes the particle appear in a seemingly intermittent state within three-dimensional space. External detection introduces additional kinetic intervention, disrupting this oscillatory state and causing what is known as quantum collapse. This can also explain the wave-particle duality of electron beams.

Another scenario involves the issue of measurement accuracy. Microscopic particles claimed to be in a superposition state are essentially in a high-speed motion state (including rapid rotation). Given current human detection methods, it is impossible to precisely measure the actual position and state of a particle; instead, one can only infer probabilistic outcomes based on the effects it produces on other particles or fields. As a result, the entire measurement process yields probabilistic outcomes of superposition and collapse states. In short, this is a question of probability rather than physics.

For example, the self-interference phenomenon observed with a single particle in the double-slit experiment can be explained as the result of aiming errors from the emission source, leading to a probability wave self-interference phenomenon after a single particle passes through one slit of the double slits. The inaccuracy of the emission source makes it impossible to predict the particle's position and trajectory precisely, resulting in the interference pattern observed on the detection screen. These interference fringes are actually formed by the mutual interference of probability waves of the particle, rather than by definite paths taken by the particle in space.
