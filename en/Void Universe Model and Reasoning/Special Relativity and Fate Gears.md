### Special Relativity Issues

Special relativity posits:

1. **Time Dilation (Time Dilation)**: When an object moves relative to another at high speed, the former's time slows down. In other words, the time experienced in a reference frame moving at high speed is less than that experienced in a stationary reference frame.
2. **Length Contraction (Length Contraction)**: When an object moves relative to another at high speed, its length in the direction of motion shrinks. This means the size of the object in the direction of motion decreases.
3. **Relativity of Simultaneity**: Two events that are simultaneous in one inertial reference frame may not be simultaneous in another relatively moving inertial reference frame.
4. **Mass-Energy Equivalence**: Mass and energy can be converted into each other. The most famous expression of this concept is Einstein's mass-energy equation $(E = mc^2)$, where $(E)$ represents energy, $(m)$ represents the mass of the object, and $(c)$ is the speed of light.

Special relativity has two fundamental assumptions:

1. **Principle of Special Relativity**
   - Einstein proposed that physical laws are the same in all inertial frames, and there is no absolute stationary reference frame.
2. **Constancy of the Speed of Light**
   - The speed of light in a vacuum is constant and independent of the motion of the light source or observer.

Firstly, point 1 allows us to use the same formulas verified by classical physics in any reference frame to derive and verify unknown physical phenomena. This forms the basis for mathematical derivations.
Next, point 2, the constancy of the speed of light, is a necessary condition for deriving results in special relativity, forming the physical foundation of special relativity.
In essence, any theoretical model that satisfies these two conditions will yield the same results as special relativity, meaning it is compatible with special relativity.

Now, let us analyze whether the Void Model satisfies these two basic conditions:

1. In the Void Model, the entire universe is a dynamically balanced three-dimensional "membrane" that is expanding continuously. All mass systems are in relative motion, and the formation mechanisms of the four fundamental forces are independent of the overall inertial state of the mass system. Therefore, physical laws are the same in all inertial frames.
2. In the Void Model, the speed of light in a vacuum is a constant determined by the density of void particles in the vacuum, so the speed of light remains constant. The measurement of the speed of light in different reference frames involves the method of measurement. If we measure the speed of light in a sealed vacuum container (excluding gravitational effects), then the measured speed of light will be the same in any inertial reference frame.

The above two points already satisfy the two basic prerequisites of special relativity. Thus, we can say that the Void Model is compatible with special relativity.
However, from point 2, the definition of the constancy of the speed of light actually presents significant issues because the method of measurement here refers to "measuring the speed of light within a sealed container." This sealed container could be a precise instrument or a closed space (such as a laboratory, basement, carriage, airplane cabin, or rocket cabin). In such closed spaces, due to the isolation effect of matter on external three-dimensional void particle flows, the void particle flow inside the closed space is relatively stationary. Hence, the measured speed of light remains constant.
A broader notion of a closed space also includes gravitationally "closed" gravitational spaces. For example, on Earth's surface, due to the influence of Earth's gravitational field, the void particle flow outside Earth cannot penetrate to the surface.
(Note: The isolation effect mentioned here refers to the relatively moving void particle flows within the three-dimensional "membrane," while the gravitational circulation of matter involves cross-dimensional flows from four-dimensional to three-dimensional space. Thus, gravitational circulation can act within the closed space, and gravitational effects are not influenced by the closed space.)

**All human experiments measuring the speed of light are essentially confined within closed containers, making it impossible to truly measure the impact of void particle flows on the speed of light.**
Thus, all Michelson-Morley-like experiments can only detect that the speed of light is the same in all directions.
Measuring the speed of light from satellites to the ground measures the gravitational redshift effect of general relativity, corresponding to the redshift effect of void particle flows from satellite orbits to the ground within the gravitational circulation (see [Gravitational Redshift and Ether Wind](../AI%20Verification/Gravitational%20Redshift%20and%20Ether%20Wind.md)).

Therefore, the discussion of time in special relativity might have issues. Under the explanation framework of this model, we can attempt to re-derive the relevant formulas of special relativity using the concept of absolute time:
([Special Relativity in Absolute Space-Time](../AI%20Verification/Special%20Relativity%20in%20Absolute Space-Time.md))
The conclusion is that we can completely derive the Lorentz transformation formula without introducing an additional time dimension, using relative spatial displacement instead.
The photon clock thought experiment often used to explain time dilation may yield results that are merely illusions of time dilation.

To verify the limitations of special relativity, we can entirely reanalyze based on the atomic clock synchronization data of lunar rovers:

1. Special relativity considers Earth and the Moon as approximate inertial reference frames, so the relative motion of the Moon with respect to Earth fully applies to the time dilation effect of special relativity.
2. In this model, Earth and the Moon are separately enclosed within their respective gravitational fields. Objects on the Moon’s surface are influenced only by the gravitational effects of general relativity. Special relativity applies only to phenomena where objects move relative to the gravitational field within a single gravitational field, such as Earth-orbit satellites requiring corrections for special relativistic effects, whereas the Moon's surface does not need to consider relative motion with respect to Earth due to the shielding effect of the gravitational field.
   Thus, analyzing the cumulative time offset data of the lunar rover over several months or even half a year can verify whether the Moon's surface experiences special relativistic time dilation compared to Earth.
   (Here, considering the relative motion between Earth and Moon affects distance measurements, the precision cannot be guaranteed, so long-term cumulative data must be analyzed.)

Why does special relativity still produce correct verification results?
Let’s revisit the light propagation formula $x=ct$. Special relativity concludes that time changes because in this formula, $c$ is constant, and when $x$ is fixed, the variable that changes is $t$. However, under the absolute space-time view, $t$ remains unchanged in any reference frame. Thus, in different reference frames, only $x$ changes. This indicates that there may be factors we haven't considered, causing what we perceive as $x$ to change into $x'$, such as equivalent spatial movement originating from four-dimensional space.

Hence, we can infer that people's perception of time calibration depends on certain physical quantities, which change under high-speed motion due to some factors, leading to the physical manifestation of slower time, thereby creating the illusion of time dilation (this is also the explanation of this model).

Now, in our Void Model, all physical phenomena are based on the fate gears at the core of each fundamental particle. Therefore, starting from the fate gear, we reverse-engineer the reasons behind the special relativistic effects.

#### Cause of Relative Mass

In our previous Void Model definitions, objects are composed of fundamental particles, which are driven by fate gears at their core and consist of four-dimensional void circulation structures. These four-dimensional void circulations form complex hyperspace circulation structures in four-dimensional space. Thus, we can define the resistance coefficient of all void particle circulations in the system against momentum changes as mass — describing the cost required to alter this momentum when an object moves in any direction in three-dimensional space.

So, this mass coefficient is directly proportional to the total momentum of the void particle flow in the system.

Next, from the related experiments of special relativity, the observed content exhibiting time dilation effects mostly involves the decay lifetimes of unstable particles, while observations of relative mass changes primarily come from high-energy particle experiments.

Let’s start with high-energy particle experiments. Assume that when an electron moves rapidly, it encounters more void particles head-on. Assuming these void particles are relatively stationary, the relative velocity between the fate gear and these void particles equals the electron's moving speed. This is equivalent to forming a new void particle circulation around the fate gear in three-dimensional space. The faster the electron moves, the faster the void particle flow becomes. When the electron's moving speed matches the speed of its four-dimensional void particle circulation, it is equivalent to adding another identical void particle circulation system. This means that if we want to change the electron's motion state, the energy cost doubles, which is equivalent to doubling the mass. This should be the cause of relative mass in special relativity.

For time dilation experiments, the observed subjects are mostly the decay lifetimes of unstable particles. In this model, the root cause of these unstable particles maintaining their structural existence lies in the relatively balanced void particle vortices surrounding their fate gears. When the balance of these vortices is disrupted, these particle structures collapse into more stable secondary structures. The rate of their decay depends on how long this balance is disrupted. Thus, higher speeds and greater densities of void particles mean larger external pressures, allowing the balance state to persist longer. This corresponds to the time dilation effects in both special and general relativity.

How much does it increase? Let’s try some simple assumptions and derivations:

In high-energy physics experiments involving individual fundamental particles, assume the original energy of the fate gear is proportional to the speed of light $(C)$. Suppose the total momentum of all void particle flows on the fate gear in a stationary state is equivalent to $(1C)$ kinetic energy momentum. When the inertial speed increases by $(1C)$, according to the law of conservation of energy, the total kinetic energy becomes $(2C)$, and the total momentum relative to the external system also becomes $(2C)$. At this point, the number of void particles hit by the fate gear per unit time in the inertial direction (relative speed of 1C) should equal the number of void particles flowing through the system per unit time in the stationary state. This means the dynamic density at the fate gear increases by $(1)$ times, resulting in the number of particles in the void particle flow increasing by $(1)$ times. Relative to the external reference frame, the total momentum increases by $(1)$ times, and the relative mass also increases by $(1)$ times.

Through calculations in special relativity, if an object's speed $v$ reaches 86.6% of the speed of light ($v=0.866c$), its relativistic mass will approximately double compared to its rest mass.
Based on this derivation (assuming that if the speed doubles, the density also doubles), we can roughly estimate that the flow speed of void particles in a stationary inertial reference frame is approximately $v=0.866c$.
(Since the results of special relativity are derived from observations on Earth, we can roughly consider this as the result calculated assuming Earth as the stationary reference frame.)

Supplementary note: The reason why the fate gear collides with more void particles comes from the complete four-dimensional direction. This is why, even in a closed container moving quickly, both general and special relativistic effects still apply simultaneously. The closed container or internal matter only restricts the three-dimensional void particle flow, while gravitational circulation invades three-dimensional space with its own flow speed from the four-dimensional direction. When the fate gear interacts with this circulation, an overlapping effect occurs. This situation makes it possible for macroscopic mass systems to fully exhibit special relativistic effects, but specific experimental verification is still needed.

For simple microscopic particles or microscopic physical phenomena easily influenced by dynamic pressure of void particles (e.g., atomic clocks), the above derivation applies.
For large-scale objects undergoing relativistic changes at high speeds, further analysis and more experimental verification are required.

(The overall motion of the four-dimensional hyperspace fluid system is an ultra-complex problem, and the above derivation is merely a conjecture about the causes of time and mass changes in special relativity.)

#### The Essence of Mass: Kinetic Energy of Four-Dimensional Circulation

##### **(1) Fate Gear and Four-Dimensional Circulation**

- In the Void Model, the mass of matter originates from the four-dimensional void particle circulation driven by its internal fate gears.
- Each fate gear drives void particles to form a four-dimensional circulation through high-speed rotation (with a maximum rotational speed of $c$).
- The energy of this circulation is the fundamental source of matter's mass.

##### **(2) Total Kinetic Energy of Four-Dimensional Circulation**

- Assume the effective output kinetic energy of a single fate gear is:

  $$
  \Delta E = \frac{1}{2} m_{\text{eff}} c^2
  $$

  Where $m_{\text{eff}}$ is the effective mass driven by a single fate gear, and $c$ is the upper limit of the fate gear's rotational speed (the speed of light).
- For composite particles made up of multiple fate gears (such as electrons, protons, etc.), the total kinetic energy is the sum of the output kinetic energies of all fate gears:

  $$
  E_{\text{total}} = \sum \Delta E = \sum \frac{1}{2} m_{\text{eff}} c^2
  $$
- The total kinetic energy can be further simplified as:

  $$
  E_{\text{total}} = m c^2
  $$

  Where $m$ is the total mass of the particle, representing the total kinetic energy of all fate gears.

#### Limitation of Energy Propagation Speed for Void Particles

##### **(1) Energy Propagation Speed of Void Particles**

- In the Void Model, the upper limit of the energy propagation speed of void particles is $c$ (the speed of light).
- Even if the fate gear's rotational speed exceeds $c$, void particles can only transmit energy from one particle to the next at the speed of $c$.

##### **(2) Upper Limit of Input Energy**

- The rotational speed of the fate gear determines the kinetic energy input driving the void particle flow.
- If the fate gear's rotational speed exceeds $c$, theoretically, it might input more kinetic energy into the void particle flow. However, since the energy propagation speed limit of void particles is $c$, this extra kinetic energy cannot be effectively transmitted.
- Therefore, the upper limit of input energy for void particle flows remains $c$.

### Summary

In the Void Model:

1. **Straight-line trajectory $L$ is an illusion**:
   - The real trajectory of photons remains the vertical distance between the two mirrors $L_0$.
   - The "diagonal" trajectory $L$ observed by external observers is due to the spatial projection effect caused by the horizontal motion of the photon clock.
2. **Time dilation $T$ is an illusion**:
   - Time dilation $T$ is a perceived phenomenon caused by the "diagonal" trajectory $L$.
   - The real time remains $T_0$, i.e., the time taken for photons to complete a round trip in the stationary reference frame.
3. **Reinterpreting experimental verifications**:
   - Current experimental results (such as extended muon lifetimes, atomic clock experiments, etc.) can be explained by other mechanisms (such as internal structural changes or variations in electromagnetic interactions) without invoking actual time dilation.

Ultimately, time dilation can be regarded as an illusion caused by spatial projection effects rather than an actual extension of time.

$$
\boxed{\text{Time dilation is an illusion reflecting spatial projection effects rather than actual changes in time.}}
