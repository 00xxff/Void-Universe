# Void Universe Hypothesis

## Abstract

This paper proposes a non-compactified four-dimensional universe model, describing a four-dimensional space composed of two types of fundamental particles. In this model, a three-dimensional "membrane" formed by the balance of four-dimensional radial pressure constitutes our perceived three-dimensional universe.

The principles of this model are straightforward and intuitive. By attributing the zero-point energy of the ground state of fundamental particles, the nuclear energy of atomic nuclei, and the dark energy driving cosmic expansion—all of which current theories cannot fully explain—to a more fundamental particle, and coupling it with another extremely small-scale particle capable of transmitting energy, we construct a four-dimensional physical framework describable through quantum mechanics, thermodynamics, and fluid dynamics. Within this framework, we can naturally explain many previously incomprehensible macroscopic and microscopic physical phenomena, including but not limited to:

- **Microscopic Level**: Characteristics of neutrinos and electrons, composition of fundamental particles, origin of chirality, formation of matter and antimatter, and the source of nuclear energy.
- **Astronomy**: Cosmic expansion, dark matter, dark energy, galactic dynamics, and the mechanisms behind large-scale cosmic structures.
- **Nature of Fundamental Forces**: Formation processes and mechanisms of gravity, electromagnetism, strong interactions, and weak interactions.
- **Quantum Mechanical Phenomena**: Quantum tunneling effects, quantum entanglement phenomena, etc.
- **Light and Electromagnetic Waves**: Generation, propagation, polarization, wave-particle duality of light, and results from single-slit and double-slit experiments.
- **Relativistic Effects**: Time dilation, mass increase, gravitational lensing in both special and general relativity.
- **Other Phenomena**: Formation of black hole horizons and jets, gravitational waves, time in quantum entanglement, origin of Higgs boson mass, symmetry breaking, and parity violation.

**Note**: Reading this article requires completely abandoning the concept of "projection." The three-dimensional membrane should be considered a real subset of four-dimensional space, with its physics entirely driven by four-dimensional fluid dynamics.

## Main Body

### 1. Introduction

Traditional higher-dimensional theories (such as string theory and Kaluza-Klein theory) typically rely on compactification to hide extra dimensions, thereby explaining why we only observe four-dimensional spacetime. However, these methods require introducing complex geometric structures (such as Calabi-Yau manifolds) and are difficult to directly link to experimental observations. This paper proposes an entirely new non-compactified four-dimensional space theory that naturally achieves constrained degrees of freedom through fluid dynamics and pressure balance mechanisms. This model not only avoids complex geometric constraints but also unifies explanations for gravity, quantum phenomena, cosmic expansion, and other physical phenomena.

### 2. Origin of the Universe

In a four-dimensional space filled with extremely small-scale B particles, there are numerous A particles. These A particles have surfaces with ceaseless light-speed cyclic fluctuations. This fluctuation not only drives the surrounding B particles to form transient vortices but also continuously creates new B particles. Due to the constant energy input from A particles, the entire four-dimensional space forms a relatively stable spatial background pressure. Under the influence of this background pressure and the gradient pressure around the A particles’ vortices, a significant number of A particles begin to aggregate, leading to uneven pressure distribution in the four-dimensional space.

When A particles aggregate to a certain scale, the boundaries of two B particle pressure groups collide, forming a three-dimensional "membrane" balanced by four-dimensional momentum direction pressure in the middle. This "membrane" is our three-dimensional universe.

Subsequently, a large number of A particles collide with the "membrane" and, under the influence of bidirectional pressure, adhere to its sides, gradually aggregating. Due to the presence of A particles, a substantial number of B particle vortices form on both sides of the "membrane," providing necessary pressure and protection for the long-term stability of the "membrane." Simultaneously, A particles drive numerous B particle flows crossing back and forth on both sides of the "membrane," forming circulation loops that ultimately construct a stable cosmic system structure.

For ease of understanding, we find concepts in existing theories similar to the characteristics of these two particles. We rename the three-dimensional form of A particles as "neutrinos" and the three-dimensional form of B particles as "ether." In four-dimensional space, we rename their four-dimensional forms as "virtual particles" and "void particles," respectively. (Note: These are not related to the corresponding concepts in quantum mechanics.)

- **Void Particles (Ether)**: Possess certain rigidity and elasticity, exhibit spatial incompatibility, and are extremely small, considered basic units constituting space.
- **Virtual Particles (Neutrinos)**: Have surfaces with ceaseless high-frequency fluctuations, being one of the sources of natural laws.

(Note: The existence of ether will be further discussed in subsequent chapters analyzing the Michelson-Morley experiment.)

The origins of virtual particles, void particles, and the perpetual motion characteristics of virtual particles belong to the extended part—the hypothesis of cosmic dimensional reduction. The fluctuation energy of virtual particles comes from their other dimensions, which will not be elaborated here.

The three major basic settings of this hypothesis include:

1. Four-dimensional "universe";
2. Four-dimensional "ether";
3. Perpetual motion "neutrinos."

These settings follow the principle of simplicity, targeting parts that standard models and the Big Bang theory cannot explain without introducing any additional entities.

Additionally, "vortices" and "circulation loops" are transient particle flows (ether flows) driven by local pressure differences caused by fluid velocity gradients. Once the pressure difference disappears, these flows rapidly vanish. Therefore, the perpetual energy output of virtual particles (neutrinos) maintains the overall pressure of the four-dimensional space without violating the law of conservation of energy.

### 3. Formation of Fundamental Particles

Virtual particles (neutrinos) combine into more complex system structures through fluid dynamic interactions. We assume that the four-dimensional form of neutrinos is a hyper-sphere-like surface with light-speed fluctuations. When immersed in the three-dimensional membrane, their three-dimensional form exhibits a non-trivial topological sphere with light-speed fluctuations. Their surface waves travel from four-dimensional space through three-dimensional space and back to four-dimensional space; thus, in three-dimensional space, we can observe the two poles of neutrinos: one pole where surface waves appear with particle flow and the other where they disappear. This fluctuation also drives surrounding void particles to form high-speed vortices accompanied by some cross-dimensional particle flows appearing and disappearing.

![Image text](../../虚空宇宙模型及推理/标准模型/media/中微子假想图.png)

To accurately describe the rotation direction (surface wave motion direction) and morphology of neutrinos, we define one pole as the "$b$ pole" and the other as the "$q$ pole":

* **$q$ Pole**: Represents the four-dimensional through-flow of particles;
* **$b$ Pole**: Represents the one-way particle flow from three-dimensional to four-dimensional space.

The rotation direction of neutrinos in three-dimensional space is from the $q$ pole to the $b$ pole.

![Image text](../../虚空宇宙模型及推理/标准模型/media/中微子概念图.png)

Since the three-dimensional morphology of neutrinos resembles a high-speed rotating gear, and given that it is the root of void pressure and all physical phenomena, playing a key role in cosmic formation, we figuratively call this shape the "Fate Gear," implying the destiny of everything in the universe.

Through fluid dynamics analysis of this conceptual diagram, we deduce that the through-flow at the $q$ pole is central to particle combination. Stable particle combinations should include at least one through-flow dominated by the $q$ pole, and the direction and quantity of $q$ poles determine the type and number of charges of the composite particles.

Assuming the $q$ pole of a neutrino represents $-\frac{1}{3}e$ charge’s four-dimensional flux and the $\bar{q}$ pole of an anti-neutrino represents $+\frac{1}{3}e$ charge’s four-dimensional flux.

Fundamental particles can be explained as follows:

* **Electron**: Composed of 3 neutrinos, combined as $qqq$, carrying $-1e$ charge;
* **Positron (anti-electron)**: Composed of 3 anti-neutrinos, combined as $\bar{q}\bar{q}\bar{q}$, carrying $+1e$ charge;
* **Up Quark**: Composed of 6 neutrinos (4 positive, 2 negative), combined as 2 positive 1 negative $bb\bar{q}$ + 2 positive 1 negative $bb\bar{q}$, carrying $+\frac{2}{3}e$ charge;
* **Down Quark**: Composed of 9 neutrinos (4 positive, 5 negative), combined as 2 positive 1 negative $bb\bar{q}$ + 1 positive 2 negative $\bar{b}\bar{b}q$ + 1 positive 2 negative $\bar{b}\bar{b}q$, carrying $-\frac{1}{3}e$ charge.
* **Proton**: Externally appears to consist of 2 up quarks and 1 down quark, inferred to also contain equal amounts of $bb\bar{q}$ and $\bar{b}\bar{b}q$ neutrino pairs of quarks and anti-quarks.
* **Neutron**: Externally appears to consist of 1 up quark and 2 down quarks, inferred to be composed of equal amounts of $bb\bar{q}$ and $\bar{b}\bar{b}q$ quark and anti-quark pairs.

We know that in chemistry, there exist **covalent bonds**, meaning atoms can combine into stable molecules by mutually sharing electrons. Similarly, the two poles of neutrinos should also be able to form more complex structures through complementary sharing.

Therefore, the topological connection of up quarks can be compressed into 4 neutrinos forming $\bar{q}bb\bar{q}$, and down quarks can be compressed into 5 neutrinos forming $q\bar{b}\bar{b}q+\bar{q}$. While π mesons (π⁺) can be written as $\bar{q}bb\bar{q} + \bar{b}\bar{q}$, making $\pi^+ \rightarrow \mu^+ + \nu_\mu$ transformable into $\bar{q}bb\bar{q}\bar{b}\bar{q} \rightarrow \bar{q}b\bar{q}\bar{b}\bar{q} + b$, and $\mu^+ \rightarrow e^+ + \nu_e + \bar{\nu}_\mu$ transforming into $\bar{q}b\bar{q}\bar{b}\bar{q} \rightarrow \bar{q}\bar{q}\bar{q} + b + \bar{b}$.

(The above derivations are mostly speculative, and any coincidences are purely accidental.)

In the Standard Model, particle spins can be described using the symmetry and direction of four-dimensional void particle circulation in this model. Neutrinos possess non-trivial four-dimensional topological structures, so their rotational behavior can be described using unit quaternions. The periodicity of unit quaternions is 720°, meaning they need to rotate two full circles to return to the initial state. Therefore, the spin number of neutrinos is 1/2, determined by their four-dimensional topological structure.

Due to their four-dimensional structure existing only on one side of the positive/negative four-dimensional space, neutrinos exhibit chiral characteristics. Other fundamental particles composed of asymmetric positive and negative neutrinos naturally possess different chiral characteristics.

Positive and negative neutrinos and electrons, composed solely of four-dimensional single-sided neutrinos, oscillate at high frequencies in four dimensions, making them extremely active in three-dimensional space and enabling them to exhibit tunneling phenomena (disappearing momentarily, moving around three-dimensional barriers or obstacles via four-dimensional space, then reappearing).

Other baryons, however, are composed of a mixed structure of positive and negative neutrinos, firmly locked onto the three-dimensional "membrane." This structure, akin to a black hole, continuously extracts void particles from three-dimensional space and injects them into four-dimensional space, serving as the source of mass and the foundation of gravity formation.

In this model, the mass of fundamental particles can be described using renormalization group flow. Relativistic mass follows similarly (see the chapter on relativistic effects below). Mass originates from the total kinetic energy of the four-dimensional circulation driven by fate gears, and differences in particle masses can be directly attributed to the number of fate gears, their combination methods (topological structure), and the complexity of the circulation they drive. (Through the relativistic mass formula of special relativity, we can simply derive that the flow velocity of void particles driven by fate gears is approximately $0.866c$).

At this point, antimatter becomes easy to understand. Why nuclear energy is so immense becomes clear. And why matter and antimatter annihilate each other, releasing vast amounts of photons, also becomes comprehensible.

### 4. The Formation of Fundamental Forces

* **Electromagnetic Force**: The gradient pressure from the vortex caused by the贯穿流 (penetrating flow) of charged particles forms the electrostatic force. The parallel three-dimensional vortex generated by the three-dimensional motion of charged particles, which is flipped in four dimensions due to conservation of angular momentum, results in a perpendicular three-dimensional precession vortex that forms the magnetic field. (In the following conceptual diagrams, interpret the electric field using a four-dimensional pressure field and the magnetic field using a four-dimensional velocity field.)

  ![Image text](../../虚空宇宙模型及推理/标准模型/media/电子互斥概念图.png)
  ![Image text](../../虚空宇宙模型及推理/标准模型/media/电子运动磁场概念图.png)

* **Strong Interaction Force**: Formed by the three-dimensional vortex action forces around particles;
* **Weak Interaction Force**: Formed by the unstable four-dimensional vortex action around particles;
* **Gravitational Force**: Formed by the combined effects of the three-dimensional spatial void pressure gradient and the four-dimensional void particle gravitational circulation.

Due to the pressure from the positive and negative four-dimensional spaces, countless void particles are constantly invading the three-dimensional space (three-dimensional "membrane"), forming a uniform three-dimensional expansion pressure. This is the background void pressure in three-dimensional space.
Near a mass system, the density distribution of void particles in four-dimensional space is spheroidal, gradually decreasing from the center outward; thus, a spherical "incremental" pressure gradient increasing inward forms around the mass center in three-dimensional space.

The matter in three-dimensional space is mainly composed of a large number of $ bbq $ neutrino composite structures, which continuously extract void particles flowing into four-dimensional space, thereby creating a low-pressure zone at the mass center. Under the combined effect of the three-dimensional void background pressure and the incremental pressure, an inward pressure gradient and a void particle flow directed towards the mass center form. We call this ultra-long-range void particle circulation across four and three dimensions the "void particle gravitational circulation."

We refer to the spherical region of void particle flow in three-dimensional space as the void sphere's gravitational region of the matter. Outside the boundary of the void sphere's gravitational region, the incremental pressure of the void particles gradually decreases until it equals the background void pressure. This spherical region is the matter’s void sphere, and we refer to the part between the boundary of the void sphere and the boundary of the void sphere's gravitational region as the repulsive region of the void sphere.

When the gravitational regions of the void spheres of two mass systems overlap, a local pressure difference occurs, generating a gravitational phenomenon under the push of the background void pressure.
When a smaller mass system is completely within the gravitational region of the void sphere of a larger mass system, the gravity it experiences is primarily determined by the gradient pressure formed by the void particle flow and the incremental pressure of the void particles in that region.

When an ultra-massive system is dominant, the gravity experienced by other small mass objects primarily originates from the spatial collapse effect produced by the void particle gravitational circulation of that system, i.e., gravitational acceleration. In this gravitational field range, regardless of the size or volume of the object, the gravitational acceleration experienced at the same position is the same, which is the four-dimensional penetrating particle flow velocity (spatial collapse acceleration) at that position, just like a sailboat being pushed by a crosswind. Therefore, here it is not because gravity produces acceleration but because there was acceleration first before the corresponding force appeared, i.e., acceleration first, then "gravity." This is because in our cognition, any change in the speed of an object must be due to an external force acting on it. Hence, we term this hypothetical "force" as gravity, and according to Newton's second law F=ma, we calculate the gravitational force.

![Image text](../../虚空宇宙模型及推理/标准模型/media/万有引力概念图.png)

In the diagram, the velocity of the void particle flow radially from four dimensions to the three-dimensional membrane within the gravitational circulation is equal to the velocity of the three-dimensional void particle flow at that position, which equals the gravitational acceleration value at that position.
We can make such a deduction: the velocity of the void particle flow at any point in the gravitational field of a planet/galaxy is equal to the gravitational acceleration value at that point, and the direction of the void particle flow is equal to the direction of the gravitational acceleration.
Now let's calculate the gravitational redshift amount between the geostationary orbit and the Earth's surface. Substituting the gravitational acceleration value into the redshift formula for light propagating in the Earth's gravitational field void particle flow, we get $\frac{\Delta \nu}{\nu} = -\frac{GM}{c^2} \left( \frac{1}{r_{\text{sync}}} - \frac{1}{R_E} \right)$, which is entirely consistent with the gravitational redshift formula of general relativity. Or, we can deduce from the gravitational redshift formula of general relativity that the velocity of the void particle flow at any point in the Earth's gravitational field equals the gravitational acceleration value at that point. When we use the velocity of the void particle flow in the gravitational circulation to calculate the time delay caused by gravitational effects, we also get the same time delay formula as general relativity $\Delta t_{\text{delay}} = \frac{GM}{c^2} \left( \frac{1}{R_E} - \frac{1}{r_{\text{sync}}} \right)$. Thus, this indicates that the void particle gravitational circulation model can fully serve as an equivalent explanation for the spacetime curvature effects in general relativity.

Galaxy dynamics problems can also be directly understood as the rotation of galaxies actually being the entire void particle group rotating, i.e., space is rotating, independent of the mass of celestial bodies within them. Therefore, the rotation morphology of galaxies depends only on the rotation morphology of space, so there is no need to introduce additional dark energy and dark matter to provide extra "gravity."

The gravitational potential energy between cosmic bodies is mainly determined by the void pressure gradient. When two massive objects attract each other due to gravity and gain kinetic energy, the kinetic energy gained by the objects due to gravity is provided by the void pressure, unrelated to the energy of the objects themselves. Neither object loses any energy; their extra kinetic energy is provided by the void pressure, which comes from the zero-point energy of neutrinos.

### 5. Light and Electromagnetic Waves

In this model, light can be explained as an interface wave on the three-dimensional membrane. The balanced four-dimensional background pressures on both sides of the three-dimensional membrane provide a uniform and constant restoring force for the formation and propagation of interface waves, akin to an ideal spring bouncing forward between two clamps. Here, the spring represents the photon's propagation relying on the elasticity (compression and rarefaction) mechanism of void particles, while the two clamps metaphorically represent the compression barriers encountered by the photon wave packet in the four-dimensional oscillation direction (analogous to the sound barrier).

Since light is an interface wave on the three-dimensional membrane, the peaks and troughs of photons are in four-dimensional space, with only the middle part existing in the three-dimensional membrane. Therefore, when observed from three-dimensional space, light manifests as segments of jumping forward quanta. The propagation speed of light is determined by the propagation medium (i.e., the density of void particles), hence it is constant.

The generation of light and electromagnetic waves is not a continuous single process but rather a group interface collision event produced by the interaction of virtual particles with void particle flows on the three-dimensional membrane. This makes light and electromagnetic waves appear as discrete group waves, and this discrete nature causes individual photons to exhibit particle characteristics. Meanwhile, at the source of photon generation events, the frequency of the event is consistent with the oscillation frequency of the photons, leading to the formation of a probability wave consistent with the frequency of individual photons. Since the cluster of photons has the same speed as the photons, the speed and wavelength of this probability wave are also the same as those of the photons.

In summary:

- A single photon is both a four-dimensional interface wave and a quantum packet jumping forward in three-dimensional space, which is the wave-particle duality of photons.
- Light consists of a large number of photons, and the propagation behavior of this photon cluster in three-dimensional space will exhibit a probability wave consistent with the wavelength and frequency of individual photons, which is the wave-particle duality of light in three-dimensional space.
- The diffraction and interference of light are actually caused by the probability wave of light. Since photons also have wave properties, single photons can exhibit diffraction phenomena, and multiple single photons appearing randomly will exhibit the characteristics of a probability wave. This is also why single photons passing through double slits can still show interference patterns of probability waves.
- When an influence is applied to the optical path to detect which slit the photon passes through, the probability wave characteristic of the photon disappears. This is why the interference pattern disappears when photons are detected in single-photon double-slit experiments.
- The peaks and troughs of photons are in four-dimensional space, making it normal for them to interact with electromagnetic fields that also act in four-dimensional space, which reasonably explains the polarization of light.

#### Matter Waves

By the same principle, matter waves are also easy to understand. When electrons oscillate in the four-dimensional radial direction, their behavior in three-dimensional space can be represented by a wave function. This oscillation allows electrons to exhibit wave-particle duality similar to photons.

#### Thermodynamic Essence

The temperature of an object reflects the intensity of the four-dimensional radial fluctuations (frequency) of all particles within it.
Heat conduction involves molecules and atoms transferring four-dimensional radial fluctuations through electrostatic force (four-dimensional gradient pressure) and van der Waals forces (local dynamic gradient pressure caused by electron movement) as well as thermal radiation.
Thermal radiation refers to the interface waves (such as light, infrared rays, electromagnetic waves) generated by the four-dimensional radial oscillations of molecules and atoms on the three-dimensional membrane.
The mechanism of temperature increase through thermal radiation occurs when an object absorbs the energy of photons, causing its molecular and atomic oscillation frequencies to increase due to resonance, thereby raising the temperature.

##### Thermal Waves

* Inside matter, heat conduction may also rely on a short-range thermal radiation — "thermal waves."
* These "thermal waves" are produced by the collision of particles oscillating in the four-dimensional radial direction with the three-dimensional membrane.
* "Thermal waves" are interface waves on the three-dimensional membrane, and their propagation relies on:
  * The restoring force provided by the four-dimensional void pressure on both sides of the three-dimensional membrane;
  * The viscosity produced by the shear deformation of void particles.
* The distinction between thermal waves and electromagnetic waves can be analogized to water waves and sound waves.

#### Photon Morphology

The polarization of light indicates that photons have three-dimensional shapes, meaning photons possess different wave packet morphologies.

Light and electromagnetic waves are not continuous linear waves but consist of discrete independent wave packets from the beginning. The generation of photons arises from high-speed (possibly superluminal) collision events occurring at the interface of the three-dimensional membrane, such as collisions of counter-rotating vortices or collisions of surface waves of fate gears with the interface. Thus, the wave packet morphology of this four-dimensional wave is determined by the subject and process of the collision.
Electromagnetic waves can only propagate through the elasticity (compression and rarefaction) of void particles, so the energy wave packet of a photon behaves like a superluminal quantum packet bouncing back and forth between two pressure layers in four dimensions, constituting the wave function representation of photons in three-dimensional space.
The faster the collision speed, the greater the energy, the faster the velocity of the superluminal quantum packet, and the higher the rebound frequency, i.e., the higher the frequency of the photon and the shorter the wavelength.
Therefore, in three-dimensional space, a photon is a surface advancing at fixed wavelengths and frequencies, which can be circular, elliptical, flat, or other distorted shapes. This surface is merely the intersection of the four-dimensional wave packet of the photon in three-dimensional space, where the three-dimensional and four-dimensional kinetic vector directions at various points on the surface are different. In four-dimensional space, these vectors manifest as magnetic and electric field vectors.

The propagation speed of light in a vacuum is constant without dispersion effects. However, when light propagates in material media (such as air, water, glass, etc.), the drastic changes in the density of void particles around atoms and molecules lead to dispersion effects. Specifically, photons with longer wavelengths more easily cross high-density regions near atoms and molecules, appearing to travel faster, while photons with shorter wavelengths tend to get trapped in high-density regions near atoms and molecules, appearing to travel slower.

#### Photon Entanglement

In this model, entangled photons result from the splitting of two photons during the same collision event, and their entanglement characteristics are manifested in the shape, energy, and direction of the four-dimensional wave packets.
For example, polarization entanglement and path entanglement can be determined by the wave packet morphology of photons, while time-energy entanglement may arise from the sequence of splitting. Spatial mode entanglement and momentum entanglement are more likely determined by the shape and momentum direction of the colliding subject.
Since these collision events, when repeated, achieve over 99.999% similarity at the human observation scale, we can basically consider their splitting modes to remain unchanged. Therefore, photons resulting from such collision events are defined as entangled photons because they are predetermined to have only two states from the moment they are generated. Thus, regardless of when or where we measure and determine the state of one photon, we can know the state of the other photon. This determination is already set from their origin, and the uncertainty principle and quantum collapse here are more philosophical issues. (See later analysis for Bell inequality issues.)

### 6. Relativistic Effects

* In this model, the entire universe is a dynamically balanced three-dimensional "membrane," with the void constantly expanding. All mass systems are in relative motion, and the formation mechanisms of the four fundamental forces are independent of the overall inertial state of the mass systems. Therefore, physical laws are the same in all inertial frames.
* In this model, the speed of light in a vacuum is constant, determined by the density of void particles in the vacuum, so the speed of light remains unchanged. The measurement of the speed of light in different reference frames involves the method of measurement. For instance, if we measure the speed of light in a sealed vacuum container (excluding the effects of gravity), then the measured speed of light will be the same in any inertial reference frame. The commonly referred inertial reference frames conform to this sealed condition, such as inside a spacecraft cabin or within a planet's closed gravitational field environment. Within these "closed" inertial reference frames, the speed of light depends only on the density of void particles and is independent of the inertial motion state of the entire reference frame.
  These two points satisfy the principle of special relativity’s special relativity and the constancy of the speed of light, so this model is compatible with special relativity (i.e., it can derive related formulas of special relativity).
  However, this model believes that we can completely derive the Lorentz transformation formula using relative spatial displacement without introducing an additional time dimension. Time is just an intermediate variable in the derivation process.

For some special physical phenomena derived from time transformations in special relativity, we can provide the following explanations:
In this model, the relativistic effects (time dilation, mass increase, length contraction) mainly apply to **high-energy experimental results of microscopic particles**, rather than directly to macroscopic large mass systems. These effects can be explained through the dynamic properties of virtual particles (fate gears) and void particle flows at the core of microscopic particles. Below is a specific analysis of each effect:

#### **(1) Time Dilation**

- **Phenomenon Description**: In high-energy experiments, the lifetime of unstable particles (such as muons) will extend as their velocity increases.
- **Mechanism Explanation**:
  - In this model, the fundamental reason for time dilation is the influence of **changes in void particle flow density** on the stability of particle systems.
  - When a microscopic particle moves at high speed, the fate gear at its core will collide with more void particles, leading to a significant increase in the density of void particle flows around it.
  - This density increase makes the void particle vortex around the fate gear more stable, thereby delaying the collapse process of the unstable particle structure. In other words, higher void particle density provides stronger external pressure, maintaining the balance state of the particle system for a longer time.
  - Therefore, from the perspective of an external observer, the particle's lifetime extends, manifesting as time dilation.

#### **(2) Mass Increase**

- **Phenomenon Description**: In high-energy experiments, the mass of microscopic particles increases as their velocity increases. When the velocity reaches $v = 0.866c$, the relativistic mass of the particle is approximately twice its rest mass.
- **Mechanism Explanation**:
  - In this model, the increase in mass is due to **the addition of an extra three-dimensional void particle flow in the direction of motion caused by the increase in velocity in three-dimensional space**.
  - Specifically, when a microscopic particle moves at high speed, the fate gear at its core will collide with more void particles. These void particles form a new fluid system in three-dimensional space and the three-dimensional direction in four-dimensional space, consistent with the particle's direction of motion.
  - When the particle's velocity reaches $v = 0.866c$, the velocity of this newly formed three-dimensional void particle flow equals the original four-dimensional void particle flow velocity of the fate gear. At this point, the core of the particle has effectively gained another void particle flow system with the same density and equal velocity, causing its total momentum to double.
  - According to the definition in this model, mass is proportional to the total momentum of the void particle circulation system. Therefore, when the velocity reaches $v = 0.866c$, the particle's mass increases by one fold.
  - It should be noted that this mass increase applies only to microscopic particles and cannot be simply generalized to macroscopic large mass systems.

#### **(3) Length Contraction**

- **Phenomenon Description**: In high-energy experiments, the effective collision cross-section of microscopic particles in the direction of motion decreases as their velocity increases.
- **Mechanism Explanation**:
  - In this model, the effect of length contraction can be attributed to **the compression of the range of void particle flow in the direction of motion**.
  - When a microscopic particle moves at high speed, the fate gear at its core will experience stronger void particle impacts in the direction of motion. This impact compresses the range of void particle flow in the direction of motion.
  - This compression effect directly affects the particle's collision cross-section, reducing its effective size in the direction of motion. From an experimental observation standpoint, this manifests as length contraction.
  - Similarly, this effect applies only to microscopic particles and cannot be directly applied to macroscopic objects.

#### **(4) Special Characteristics of Macroscopic Large Mass Systems**

- In this model, relativistic effects (time dilation, mass increase, length contraction) are primarily explanations for **high-energy experimental results of microscopic particles**, not universally applicable to all physical systems.
- For **macroscopic large mass systems**, which are composed of a large number of microscopic particles, interactions between these particles and the overall structure may shield or weaken the relativistic effects of individual particles. Therefore, macroscopic large mass systems moving at high speeds may not exhibit the same relativistic effects as microscopic particles.
- For example:
  - Whether the passage of time in macroscopic objects is affected by relativistic effects depends on the average behavior of their internal microscopic particles and the overall system dynamics.
  - Changes in mass and length contraction in macroscopic objects may require more complex analyses, especially involving the dynamic effects of gravitational fields and void spheres.

#### **(5) Relationship with General Relativity**

- Phenomena such as time dilation and gravitational redshift in general relativity can be explained through the flow and density changes of void particles:
  - In strong gravitational fields, the density of void particles significantly increases, making the void particle vortices around fate gears more stable, thereby extending the lifetime of unstable particles (time dilation).
  - Gravitational lensing and black hole horizon phenomena are closely related to the direction and velocity distribution of void particle flows.
  - The gravitational redshift formula derived from gravitational acceleration values aligns with the gravitational redshift formula of general relativity, indicating that under non-extreme conditions, gravitational redshift phenomena can be directly explained by void particle gravitational circulation.

#### **(6) Mass-Energy Equivalence**

In this model, the essence of both mass and energy can be attributed to the momentum distribution of virtual particles and void particle flows. According to Einstein's mass-energy equation $E = mc^2$, mass can be considered a highly concentrated form of energy. In this model, this relationship can be explained through the high-frequency oscillation of virtual particles and the void particle circulation they drive: the oscillation energy of virtual particles is directly converted into the kinetic energy of void particle flows, manifesting as mass or energy.

#### **Summary**

In this model, relativistic effects (time dilation, mass increase, length contraction) mainly apply to **high-energy experimental results of microscopic particles**, and their fundamental reasons are:

1. **Time Dilation**: The increase in void particle flow density prolongs the lifetime of unstable particles.
2. **Mass Increase**: The increase in velocity in three-dimensional space leads to an additional three-dimensional void particle flow at the core; when the velocity reaches $v = 0.866c$, the mass doubles.
3. **Length Contraction**: The range of void particle flow in the direction of motion is compressed, leading to a smaller collision cross-section.

These effects cannot be simply generalized to macroscopic large mass systems because the complexity and overall dynamics of macroscopic systems may shield or weaken the relativistic effects of individual particles.

### 7. Michelson-Morley Experiment

#### **1. Background and Traditional Explanation**

The Michelson-Morley experiment aimed to detect the existence of "ether wind," i.e., the motion of the medium through which light waves propagate relative to the Earth. However, the experimental results showed that regardless of the Earth's motion state, the speed of light remained constant in all directions. This result negated the classical ether hypothesis and laid the foundation for the proposal of special relativity.

However, in this model, "ether" is redefined as **void particles**, which serve as the medium for the propagation of light and electromagnetic waves. Void particles have dynamic flow characteristics influenced by gravitational fields. Therefore, we need to reanalyze the results of the Michelson-Morley experiment based on the characteristics of void particle flow within the Earth's gravitational field.

**Direct conclusion: In this model, "ether wind" corresponds to void particle flow, and on Earth, the void particle flow is the gravitational circulation of the gravitational field. Thus, the effect of this void particle flow on light rays corresponds to the influence of the gravitational field on light rays, corresponding to the gravitational lensing effect in general relativity. Additionally, since the distribution of the gravitational field around the Earth is uniform, the distribution of void particle flow around the Earth is also uniform, so the Michelson-Morley experiment (including modern high-precision experiments) cannot yield results beyond gravitational effects, i.e., (excluding gravitational effects) the speed of light around the Earth appears isotropic in all directions.**

#### **2. Characteristics of Void Particle Flow in the Earth's Gravitational Field**

Based on the derivation of the nature of universal gravitation in this model:

- Within the Earth's gravitational field, void particles flow from outer space towards the Earth's center, forming a spherical void particle flow (the three-dimensional part of the gravitational circulation).
- The velocity value of the void particle flow at any point in the gravitational field equals the gravitational acceleration value at that point, directed towards the Earth's center.
  - For example, on the Earth's surface, the velocity of the void particle flow is about $g = 9.8 \, \text{m/s}$, directed vertically downward.
- This void particle flow is driven by the gravitational circulation invading from four-dimensional space into three-dimensional space and is uniformly distributed throughout the gravitational field.

Therefore, near the Earth's surface, the main characteristics of the void particle flow are:

1. **Directionality**: The direction of the void particle flow always points towards the Earth's center and does not change with the Earth's revolution or rotation.
2. **Velocity Value**: The velocity of the void particle flow is low (about $9.8 \, \text{m/s}$), far less than the speed of light ($c \approx 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}$).
3. **Relative Rest**: Since the void particle flow rotates synchronously with the Earth's gravitational field, the void particle flow near the Earth's surface remains relatively stationary with respect to the Earth in other directions.

#### **3. Reanalysis of the Michelson-Morley Experiment**

Based on the above characteristics, we can reanalyze the results of the Michelson-Morley experiment.

##### **(1) Experimental Design and Expectations**

The core assumption of the Michelson-Morley experiment is: if "ether wind" exists, then the propagation speed of light in different directions would vary due to the Earth's motion relative to the "ether." The experiment measures the phase difference between two beams of light using an interferometer to detect such velocity differences.

In the traditional ether hypothesis, "ether" is regarded as a rigid, static medium, and the Earth's movement within it generates "ether wind." However, in this model:

- The direction of the void particle flow always points towards the Earth's center, rather than changing with the Earth's revolution or rotation.
- The vertical void particle flow velocity is extremely low (about $9.8 \, \text{m/s}$), far less than the speed of light, thus having negligible effects on the speed of light.
- The void particle flow in other directions near the Earth's surface remains relatively stationary with the Earth, meaning there is no significant "ether wind" on the Earth's surface.

##### **(2) Explanation of Experimental Results**

According to the theory of this model, the reasons why the Michelson-Morley experiment failed to detect "ether wind" are as follows:

1. **Low-speed characteristics of void particle flow**:
   - On the Earth's surface, the velocity of the void particle flow is only $9.8 \, \text{m/s}$, which is negligible compared to the speed of light, thus having a negligible impact on light phase, far below the experimental precision of the Michelson-Morley experiment.
   - The propagation speed of light is mainly determined by the density of void particles, and the density of void particles on the Earth's surface is relatively uniform, resulting in the constancy of the speed of light in different directions.
2. **Relative rest of void particle flow**:
   - The void particle flow near the Earth's surface rotates synchronously with the Earth, so within the Earth's reference frame, the void particle flow appears relatively stationary.
   - This means there is no significant "ether wind" on the Earth's surface, explaining the absence of observed interference fringe changes in the Michelson-Morley experiment.
3. **Shielding effect of the gravitational field**:
   - The void particle flow within the Earth's gravitational field forms a stable spherical structure, shielding disturbances from external void particle flows.
   - Therefore, the void particle flow on the Earth's surface is unaffected by the Earth's revolution or solar system motion, further ensuring the isotropy of the speed of light.

##### **(3) Experimental Limitations**

The design of the Michelson-Morley experiment is based on the following assumptions:

- "Ether" is a rigid, static medium.
- The Earth's motion relative to "ether" generates significant "ether wind."

However, in this model:

- Void particles are dynamic, non-rigid media (with density variations).
- The velocity of the vertical void particle flow near the Earth's surface is extremely low, and in other directions, it remains relatively stationary with the Earth's rotation.

Therefore, the Michelson-Morley experiment actually did not negate the hypothesis that light requires a medium to propagate but only negated the hypothesis of a static "ether."

#### **4. Conclusion**

In this model, the reasons why the Michelson-Morley experiment failed to detect "ether wind" can be summarized as follows:

1. The velocity of the vertical void particle flow within the Earth's gravitational field is extremely low (about $9.8 \, \text{m/s}$), far below the experimental precision of the Michelson-Morley experiment.
2. The void particles near the Earth's surface remain relatively stationary with the Earth, leading to the absence of significant "ether wind" within the Earth's reference frame.
3. The Earth's gravitational field shields disturbances from external void particle flows, ensuring the isotropy of the speed of light.

### 8. Explanation and Speculation of Other Physical Phenomena

#### Black Holes

The gravitational circulation in the gravitational field of a black hole moves at extremely high speeds, with the flux of void particles approaching or even exceeding the speed of light near the black hole's surface. Under these extreme conditions, a superluminal vortex of void particles forms at the center of the black hole, preventing photons from escaping from within the black hole, thus forming the event horizon.

When a black hole rotates at high speed, low-speed vortex regions may form at its poles due to rotational effects. These regions have lower velocities of void particle flow, allowing some high-energy rays to escape, forming black hole jets.

At the center of the black hole, the immense velocity and pressure of the gravitational circulation might tear apart the structures of fundamental particles, releasing large amounts of free neutrinos and antineutrinos. These neutrinos and antineutrinos are then carried into four-dimensional space by the gravitational circulation, making the four-dimensional part of the black hole more akin to the early state of the universe’s formation. As these neutrinos and antineutrinos re-enter the three-dimensional membrane along with the black hole’s gravitational circulation, they appear in the surrounding three-dimensional space, while some free neutrinos and antineutrinos might combine to form electrons and positrons. Thus, it is reasonable to believe that the vacuum around black holes should have a higher density of neutrinos, antineutrinos, electrons, and positrons compared to other parts of the universe, accompanied by a large number of electron-positron annihilation events.

#### Gravitational Waves

Hypothesis one: Gravitational waves are mega-interface waves produced by the vibrations of the three-dimensional membrane caused by the high-speed collision of massive celestial bodies (such as binary black hole systems). When two massive celestial bodies orbit each other and eventually merge, their surrounding void particle flows undergo violent collisions, producing mega-interface waves that propagate outward at the speed of light. We can view the wave packet of this mega-interface wave as a "macro-photon," borrowing the concept of macro-electrons from Liu Cixin's novels. This macro-photon propagates similarly to a photon, so it also has polarization properties. Its polarization properties manifest as periodic changes in the density distribution of void particles in the region it passes through, consistent with its elastic structure. This density change causes differences in the speed of light passing through these different density regions (i.e., phase differences), leading to interference phenomena observed in gravitational wave detection experiments.
Hypothesis two: Gravitational waves are "sound waves" within the three-dimensional membrane caused by the high-speed collision of massive celestial bodies (such as binary black hole systems). The "speed of sound" of void particles in the three-dimensional membrane is the speed of light, so gravitational waves are four-dimensional longitudinal waves propagating within the three-dimensional membrane. Since the deformation direction of four-dimensional longitudinal waves aligns with their propagation direction and occurs in four-dimensional space, their wave packets can be alternately stretched and compressed when viewed in a three-dimensional slice, i.e., the transverse wave characteristics and polarization patterns we observe in gravitational waves.

#### Quantum Entanglement Time

In this model, quantum entanglement phenomena can be explained by the symmetry of particles' four-dimensional momentum structures. Recent experimental data show that the time required to establish quantum entanglement is approximately $232 \, \text{as}$, which closely matches the time needed for the void particle stream emitted from the core of an electron to pass through the diameter of a helium atom (about $240 \, \text{as}$) in this model. This suggests that the establishment of quantum entangled states may depend on the transient dynamics process of virtual particles and void particle streams. The establishment of quantum entanglement involves the creation of each particle's four-dimensional momentum structure, and measurement-induced quantum collapse is akin to opening a blind box.

#### Bell's Inequality

In 2016, the large Bell experiment proved that Bell's inequality does not hold. In this model, the experimental results can be explained as follows:
Measurements of high-dimensional quantum states yield low-dimensional results with information loss issues. If the actual state of entangled particles exists in high-dimensional space, the low-dimensional measurement results may be projections of high-dimensional information. Such projections may cause certain result combinations to deviate from classical hidden variable theory predictions (i.e., the combinations are not random), thereby violating Bell's inequality. The failure of Bell's inequality may be due to statistical effects caused by high-dimensional projections rather than unique properties of quantum entanglement.
Each photon’s wave function is relatively independent, whereas entangled photons exhibit wave function correlations. Statistically, they can be considered as the same photon (either the same or different aspects), and sequentially measuring two entangled photons using polarizers at fixed angles approximates a single photon passing through two polarizers at fixed angles. Therefore, the probability of this result is $P = \cos^2\theta$.

For details, please refer to the de Broglie-Bohm theory.

#### Origin of Higgs Boson Mass

The mass of the Higgs boson can be explained through the high-frequency fluctuations of virtual particles and the kinetic energy of the void particle circulation they drive. The fluctuation energy of virtual particles directly converts into the kinetic energy of void particle flows, thereby imparting mass to fundamental particles. This mechanism is consistent with the Higgs mechanism in the Standard Model but provides a more intuitive physical image in this model. The Higgs bosons observed in high-energy physics experiments may just be clusters of high-energy instantaneous void particle vortices. The lifetime of the Higgs boson is about $160 \, \text{as}$, which aligns with the timescale for transient void particle vortex flattening.

#### Symmetry Breaking and Parity Non-conservation

In this model, parity non-conservation phenomena can be explained by the chirality of virtual particles (neutrinos) and the directionality of the four-dimensional void particle flows they drive. The four-dimensional polarity (positive and negative) of virtual particles determines their chiral characteristics, which further influence the behavior of composite particles made up of virtual particles. For example, parity non-conservation in weak interactions can be attributed to the asymmetric vortex structure of virtual particles. Specifically, the four-dimensional topological structure of cobalt atoms is determined by the positive and negative neutrinos composing the electrons, protons, and neutrons. The directions of the four-dimensional circulation of these neutrinos cannot be reversed under three-dimensional mirror operations, so simple three-dimensional mirrors can only alter part of the overall four-dimensional topological structure without changing the essential chirality of the fundamental particles. This leads to the observed asymmetrical phenomena in experiments, such as the preferred emission direction of electrons in beta decay differing from expectations. (In **CPT symmetry**, the three-dimensional mirror operation of cobalt atoms is merely a three-dimensional spatial inversion (P); for parity conservation, a fourth-dimensional spatial inversion is also required, i.e., charge conjugation (C), flipping cobalt atoms into anti-cobalt atoms.)

#### Cosmic Expansion and Dark Energy

The fundamental reason for cosmic expansion lies in the continuous increase in the number of void particles and the continuous energy output of virtual particles' light-speed fluctuations, leading to constant changes in the pressure gradient throughout four-dimensional space. This pressure gradient change drives the expansion of the three-dimensional membrane, manifesting as cosmic expansion. Dark energy can be regarded as the macroscopic manifestation of the four-dimensional permeation and expansion pressure of void particles, with its source explainable by the perpetual motion characteristics of virtual particles.

#### Dark Matter

Dark matter phenomena can be explained by the properties of void spheres. The rotation curve problem of galaxies and galaxy clusters indicates that, besides visible matter, there exists an invisible matter component providing additional gravity. In this model, universal gravitation is formed by the combined action of void pressure gradients and four-dimensional gravitational circulation, so galaxy dynamics problems are actually fluid dynamics problems of void particles in three-dimensional space, resulting from the interaction between the three-dimensional space background pressure and the four-dimensional space pressure gradient of galaxies themselves, not directly related to stellar mass. Therefore, no additional mass is needed to provide extra gravity.

#### Superconductivity

Superconductivity can be described by the vortex field of void particles in three-dimensional space.
First, from the previous thermodynamic essence, we know that the temperature of an object reflects the intensity of four-dimensional radial fluctuations of all internal particles; and thermal conduction is achieved through electrostatic forces (four-dimensional gradient pressure) and van der Waals forces (local dynamic gradient pressure caused by electron motion) and thermal radiation (electromagnetic waves and thermal waves). Among them, electrostatic forces remain unchanged, so temperature changes only affect van der Waals forces and thermal radiation, both of which interact with electron motion. Thus, superconductivity can be understood as follows: when the material temperature decreases, its four-dimensional radial fluctuations tend to stabilize, and the generated thermal wave disturbances also stabilize. The internal lattice of the material gradually stabilizes and solidifies, forming a stable vortex field. In this vortex field, when free electrons pass through internally, the van der Waals forces and thermal waves produced by electron motion are fed back to the electrons themselves, resulting in no kinetic energy loss, which is the zero-resistance phenomenon. The reason why carriers usually appear in pairs might be because the feedback mechanism requires a more complex topological structure, which needs pairing to satisfy.
Based on the electron concept diagram, we can infer that when two electrons pair, their void particle flows at the poles in three-dimensional space can complement each other, forming a relatively "stable" electron pair. This "stable" electron pair moves more orderly and no longer collides randomly, experiencing less resistance, thus exhibiting superconductivity. From this analysis, it seems similar to the Cooper pair superconductivity mechanism in BCS theory. Thus, lowering the temperature simultaneously reduces the four-dimensional oscillation frequency of electrons and creates constraints allowing adjacent electrons to combine into "stable" electron pairs, achieving superconductivity. Further analyzing from the "electron movement produces magnetic field concept diagram" above, when two electrons form a complementary electron pair, they are actually in a front-and-back spin state, i.e., total spin of 0. When this electron pair moves in one direction, the precession particle flow (magnetic field) they produce points in opposite directions. Of course, this does not mean their magnetic fields cancel out directly but should interact and shift to other positions (while the possibly existing external magnetic field is also affected), which is the perfect diamagnetism of superconductors.
